abstract = {Cytoplasmic dyneins are motor proteins in the AAA+ superfamily that power transport of cellular cargos towards microtubule minus-ends. Recently, ciliobrevins were reported as selective cell-permeable inhibitors of cytoplasmic dyneins. As is often true for first-in-class inhibitors, the use of ciliobrevins has been limited by low potency. Moreover, suboptimal chemical properties, such as the potential to isomerize, have hindered efforts to improve ciliobrevins. Here, we characterized the structure of ciliobrevins and designed conformationally-constrained isosteres. We identified dynapyrazoles, inhibitors more potent than ciliobrevins in vitro, and find that while ciliobrevins inhibit both dynein's microtubule-stimulated and basal ATPase activity, dynapyrazoles block only microtubule-stimulated activity. Single-digit micromolar concentrations of dynapyrazoles block intraflagellar transport in the cilium and lysosome motility in the cytoplasm, processes that depend on cytoplasmic dyneins. Together, our studies suggest that chemical structure-based analyses can lead to inhibitors with distinct modes of inhibition and improved properties.},

abstract = {Cellular communication drives diverse aspects of organismal biology ranging from immune function to memory formation. The mechanisms by which cells transact information in vivo, though, are not completely understood. This is due, in part, to a lack of tools for observing collections of cells in their native habitats. New optical probes are being crafted to image networks of cell-cell interactions (i.e., 'interactomes') in tissues and live organisms. Examples of these probes-and their use in visualizing cell contacts and macroscopic cell networks-are highlighted.},

abstract = {Copper is a required metal nutrient for life, but global or local alterations in its homeostasis are linked to diseases spanning genetic and metabolic disorders to cancer and neurodegeneration. Technologies that enable longitudinal in vivo monitoring of dynamic copper pools can help meet the need to study the complex interplay between copper status, health, and disease in the same living organism over time. Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and in vivo imaging applications of Copper-Caged Luciferin-1 (CCL-1), a bioluminescent reporter for tissue-specific copper visualization in living animals. CCL-1 uses a selective copper(I)-dependent oxidative cleavage reaction to release d-luciferin for subsequent bioluminescent reaction with firefly luciferase. The probe can detect physiological changes in labile Cu(+) levels in live cells and mice under situations of copper deficiency or overload. Application of CCL-1 to mice with liver-specific luciferase expression in a diet-induced model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease reveals onset of hepatic copper deficiency and altered expression levels of central copper trafficking proteins that accompany symptoms of glucose intolerance and weight gain. The data connect copper dysregulation to metabolic liver disease and provide a starting point for expanding the toolbox of reactivity-based chemical reporters for cell- and tissue-specific in vivo imaging.},

All analogues produced light with firefly luciferase, although varying levels of emission were observed. Differences in photon output were analyzed by computation and photophysical measurements. The brightest brominated luciferin was further evaluated in cell and animal models. At low doses, the analogue outperformed the native substrate in cells. The remaining luciferins, although weak emitters with firefly luciferase, were inherently capable of light production and thus potential substrates for orthogonal mutant enzymes.},

abstract = {Manipulation of neuronal activity through genetically targeted actuator molecules is a powerful approach for studying information flow in the brain. In these approaches the genetically targeted component, a receptor or a channel, is activated either by a small molecule (chemical genetics) or by light from a physical source (optogenetics). We developed a hybrid technology that allows control of the same neurons by both optogenetic and chemical genetic means. The approach is based on engineered chimeric fusions of a light-generating protein (luciferase) to a light-activated ion channel (channelrhodopsin). Ionic currents then can be activated by bioluminescence upon activation of luciferase by its substrate, coelenterazine (CTZ), as well as by external light. In cell lines, expression of the fusion of Gaussia luciferase to Channelrhodopsin-2 yielded photocurrents in response to CTZ. Larger photocurrents were produced by fusing the luciferase to Volvox Channelrhodopsin-1. This version allowed chemical modulation of neuronal activity when expressed in cultured neurons: CTZ treatment shifted neuronal responses to injected currents and sensitized neurons to fire action potentials in response to subthreshold synaptic inputs. These luminescent channelrhodopsins--or luminopsins--preserve the advantages of light-activated ion channels, while extending their capabilities. Our proof-of-principle results suggest that this novel class of tools can be improved and extended in numerous ways.},

abstract = {In vivo molecular imaging holds promise for understanding the underlying mechanisms of health, injury, aging, and disease, as it can detect distinct biochemical processes such as enzymatic activity, reactive small-molecule fluxes, or post-translational modifications. Current imaging techniques often detect only a single biochemical process, but, within whole organisms, multiple types of biochemical events contribute to physiological and pathological phenotypes. In this report, we present a general strategy for dual-analyte detection in living animals that employs in situ formation of firefly luciferin from two complementary caged precursors that can be unmasked by different biochemical processes. To establish this approach, we have developed Peroxy Caged Luciferin-2 (PCL-2), a H(2)O(2)-responsive boronic acid probe that releases 6-hydroxy-2-cyanobenzothiazole (HCBT) upon reacting with this reactive oxygen species, as well as a peptide-based probe, z-Ile-Glu-ThrAsp-D-Cys (IETDC), which releases D-cysteine in the presence of active caspase 8. Once released, HCBT and D-cysteine form firefly luciferin in situ, giving rise to a bioluminescent signal if and only if both chemical triggers proceed. This system thus constitutes an AND-type molecular logic gate that reports on the simultaneous presence of H(2)O(2) and caspase 8 activity. Using these probes, chemoselective imaging of either H(2)O(2) or caspase 8 activity was performed in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, concomitant use of PCL-2 and IETDC in vivo establishes a concurrent increase in both H(2)O(2) and caspase 8 activity during acute inflammation in living mice. Taken together, this method offers a potentially powerful new chemical tool for studying simultaneous oxidative stress and inflammation processes in living animals during injury, aging, and disease, as well as a versatile approach for concurrent monitoring of multiple analytes using luciferin-based bioluminescence imaging technologies.},

abstract = {Fluorescence live imaging has become an essential methodology in modern cell biology. However, fluorescence requires excitation light, which can sometimes cause potential problems, such as autofluorescence, phototoxicity, and photobleaching. Furthermore, combined with recent optogenetic tools, the light illumination can trigger their unintended activation. Because luminescence imaging does not require excitation light, it is a good candidate as an alternative imaging modality to circumvent these problems. The application of luminescence imaging, however, has been limited by the two drawbacks of existing luminescent protein probes, such as luciferases: namely, low brightness and poor color variants. Here, we report the development of bright cyan and orange luminescent proteins by extending our previous development of the bright yellowish-green luminescent protein Nano-lantern. The color change and the enhancement of brightness were both achieved by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) from enhanced Renilla luciferase to a fluorescent protein. The brightness of these cyan and orange Nano-lanterns was ∼20 times brighter than wild-type Renilla luciferase, which allowed us to perform multicolor live imaging of intracellular submicron structures. The rapid dynamics of endosomes and peroxisomes were visualized at around 1-s temporal resolution, and the slow dynamics of focal adhesions were continuously imaged for longer than a few hours without photobleaching or photodamage. In addition, we extended the application of these multicolor Nano-lanterns to simultaneous monitoring of multiple gene expression or Ca(2+) dynamics in different cellular compartments in a single cell.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Despite a plethora of bioluminescent reporter genes being cloned and used for cell assays and molecular imaging purposes, the simultaneous monitoring of multiple events in small animals is still challenging. This is partly attributable to the lack of optimization of cell reporter gene expression as well as too much spectral overlap of the color-coupled reporter genes. A new red emitting codon-optimized luciferase reporter gene mutant of Photinus pyralis, Ppy RE8, has been developed and used in combination with the green click beetle luciferase, CBG99.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were transfected with vectors that expressed red Ppy RE8 and green CBG99 luciferases. Populations of red and green emitting cells were mixed in different ratios. After addition of the shared single substrate, D-luciferin, bioluminescent (BL) signals were imaged with an ultrasensitive cooled CCD camera using a series of band pass filters (20 nm). Spectral unmixing algorithms were applied to the images where good separation of signals was observed. Furthermore, HEK293 cells that expressed the two luciferases were injected at different depth in the animals. Spectrally-separate images and quantification of the dual BL signals in a mixed population of cells was achieved when cells were either injected subcutaneously or directly into the prostate.

SIGNIFICANCE:We report here the re-engineering of different luciferase genes for in vitro and in vivo dual color imaging applications to address the technical issues of using dual luciferases for imaging. In respect to previously used dual assays, our study demonstrated enhanced sensitivity combined with spatially separate BL spectral emissions using a suitable spectral unmixing algorithm. This new D-luciferin-dependent reporter gene couplet opens up the possibility in the future for more accurate quantitative gene expression studies in vivo by simultaneously monitoring two events in real time.},

abstract = {Coelenterazine is widely distributed among marine organisms, producing bioluminescence by calcium-insensitive oxidation mediated by Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and calcium-dependent oxidation mediated by the photoprotein aequorin. Despite its abundance in nature and wide use of both proteins as reporters of gene expression and signal transduction, little is known about mechanisms of coelenterazine transport and cell permeation. Interestingly, coelenterazine analogues share structural and physiochemical properties of compounds transported by the multidrug resistance MDR1 P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Herein, we report that living cells stably transfected with a codon-humanized Rluc show coelenterazine-mediated bioluminescence in a highly MDR1 Pgp-modulated manner. In Pgp-expressing Rluc cells, low baseline bioluminescence could be fully enhanced (reversed) to non-Pgp matched control levels with potent and selective Pgp inhibitors. Therefore, using coelenterazine and noninvasive bioluminescence imaging in vivo, we could directly monitor tumor-specific Pgp transport inhibition in living mice. While enabling molecular imaging and high-throughput screening of drug resistance pathways, these data also raise concern for the indiscriminate use of Rluc and aequorin as reporters in intact cells or transgenic animals, wherein Pgp-mediated alterations in coelenterazine permeability may impact results.},

In addition to the tris(triazolylamines) previously reported, two types of compounds (bipy/phen and 2-pyridyl Schiff bases) were found to exhibit significant ligand-accelerated catalysis, with one complex showing especially dramatic rate enhancements.

abstract = {The cDNA encoding the luciferase from the Italian firefly Luciola italica was cloned using reverse transcriptase-PCR and a gene-specific primer set based on the DNA sequence of Luciola mingrelica. The cDNA sequence of L. italica luciferase was determined to be 1647 base pairs in length with an open reading frame of 548 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis of the protein sequence demonstrated that this luciferase is closely related to that of other fireflies of the Lampyridae family, particularly within the Luciolinae subfamily, showing 96% homology to luciferases from the fireflies Hotaria unmunsana and Hotaria parvula. The specific activity of the L. italica luciferase was 78% of the North American enzyme, after correction for emission color differences. The bioluminescence emission of the Italian firefly is pH sensitive with maxima at 566 nm and 614 nm at pH 7.8 and 6.0, respectively. Interestingly, the total bioluminescence output was approximately 2-fold greater than that of P. pyralis luciferase due to differences in turnover characteristics evidenced by extended light emission decay kinetics. We expect that this newly discovered luciferase will be suitable for a wide range of bioluminescence applications including in vivo imaging and multiplex assays.},

abstract = {Enzymes in heteromeric, allosterically regulated complexes catalyze a rich array of chemical reactions. Separating the subunits of such complexes, however, often severely attenuates their catalytic activities, because they can no longer be activated by their protein partners. We used directed evolution to explore allosteric regulation as a source of latent catalytic potential using the $\beta$-subunit of tryptophan synthase from Pyrococcus furiosus (PfTrpB). As part of its native $\alpha$$\beta$$\beta$$\alpha$ complex, TrpB efficiently produces tryptophan and tryptophan analogs; activity drops considerably when it is used as a stand-alone catalyst without the $\alpha$-subunit. Kinetic, spectroscopic, and X-ray crystallographic data show that this lost activity can be recovered by mutations that reproduce the effects of complexation with the $\alpha$-subunit. The engineered PfTrpB is a powerful platform for production of Trp analogs and for further directed evolution to expand substrate and reaction scope.},

abstract = {The cytoplasmic Myc protein (c-Myc) regulates various human genes and is dysregulated in many human cancers. Phosphorylation mediates the protein activation of c-Myc and is essential for the function of this transcription factor in normal cell behavior and tumor growth. To date, however, the targeting of Myc as a therapeutic approach for cancer treatment has been achieved primarily at the nonprotein level. We have developed a molecular imaging sensor for noninvasive imaging of c-Myc activity in living subjects using a split Firefly luciferase (FL) complementation strategy to detect and quantify the phosphorylation-mediated interaction between glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) and c-Myc. This sensor system consists of two fusion proteins, GSK 35-433-CFL and NFL-c-Myc, in which specific fragments of GSK3beta and c-Myc are fused with C-terminal and N-terminal fragments of the split FL, respectively. The sensor detects phosphorylation-specific GSK3beta-c-Myc interaction, the imaging signal of which correlates with the steady-state and temporal regulation of c-Myc phosphorylation in cell culture. The sensor also detects inhibition of c-Myc activity via differential pathways, allowing noninvasive monitoring of c-Myc-targeted drug efficacy in intact cells and living mice. Notably, this drug inhibition is detected before changes in tumor size are apparent in mouse xenograft and liver tumor models. This reporter system not only provides an innovative way to investigate the role of functional c-Myc in normal and cancer-related biological processes, but also facilitates c-Myc-targeted drug development by providing a rapid quantitative approach to assessing cancer response to therapy in living subjects.},

abstract = {Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on histone tails act in diverse combinations in the 'histone code' to control gene expression, with dysregulation observed in a variety of diseases. However, detection and sensing methods are limited, expensive, and/or low-throughput, including MS and antibody based detection. We found that by combining four synthetic receptors developed by dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) in an indicator displacement system, we are able to create a pattern-based sensor platform that can discriminate single PTMs such as methylation and acetylation on a representative histone peptide with 100% accuracy as well as peptides bearing both dimethyl and trimethyl lysine in the presence of arginine methylation, which has not previously been demonstrated, and can even correctly distinguish the position of lysine methylation individually or in the presence of other PTMs. To extend this approach, a full panel of thirteen analytes containing different combinations of PTMs were classified with 96 {\textpm} 1% overall accuracy in a 50% left-out analysis, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the sensor array. Finally, the sensor platform was also used to demonstrate proof of concept for enzymatic assays by analysing the mock reaction of a threonine kinase, successfully identifying analytes representative of substrate conversion both with and without neighboring PTMs. This work provides a rapid platform for the analysis of peptides bearing complex modifications and highlights the utility of receptors discovered though DCC that display variations in binding affinity and selectivity.},

abstract = {To advance our understanding of biological processes as they occur in living animals, imaging strategies have been developed and refined that reveal cellular and molecular features of biology and disease in real time. One rapid and accessible technology for in vivo analysis employs internal biological sources of light emitted from luminescent enzymes, luciferases, to label genes and cells. Combining this reporter system with the new generation of charge coupled device (CCD) cameras that detect the light transmitted through the animal's tissues has opened the door to sensitive in vivo measurements of mammalian gene expression in living animals. Here, we review the development and application of this imaging strategy, in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI), together with in vivo fluorescence imaging methods, which has enabled the real-time study of immune cell trafficking, of various genetic regulatory elements in transgenic mice, and of in vivo gene transfer. BLI has been combined with fluorescence methods that together offer access to in vivo measurements that were not previously available. Such studies will greatly facilitate the functional analysis of a wide range of genes for their roles in health and disease.},

A variety of substituted cyclopropene scaffolds were synthesized and found to be stable in aqueous solution and in the presence of biological nucleophiles. Furthermore, some of the cyclopropene units were metabolically introduced into cell surface glycans and subsequently detected with covalent probes. The small size and selective reactivity of cyclopropenes will facilitate efforts to tag diverse collections of biomolecules in vivo.},

abstract = {Three semi-rational approaches, combinatorial site-saturation mutagenesis (CSSM) using a reduced amino acid set and two libraries based on Corbit and CRAM computational design algorithms targeting up to 10 active site residues, were used to engineer cytochrome P450 BM3 to demethylate dimethyl ether and hydroxylate propane and ethane. These small libraries (343{\textendash}1028 variants) were all enriched with respect to the fraction functional and maximal activities compared with a random mutagenesis library and individual site-saturation libraries targeting the same residues. Despite high average amino acid substitution levels of 2.6, 5 and 7.5, the CSSM, Corbit and CRAM libraries had at least 75% of library members properly folded. Propane- and ethane-hydroxylating P450 BM3 variants were identified using all three mutagenesis approaches, with as few as two amino acid substitutions. The library designed using the CRAM algorithm, which sought to reduce the size of the binding pocket, produced both a higher number of active variants and variants supporting the greatest number of catalytic turnovers. The most active variant E32 supports 16 800 propane turnovers at 36% coupling, which rivals the activity of variants obtained after 10{\textendash}12 rounds of directed evolution using random and site-saturation mutagenesis. None of the variants in this study achieved the complete re-specialization for propane hydroxylation (including 93% coupling) previously obtained via multiple rounds of mutagenesis and screening. However, these semi-rational approaches allowed for large jumps in sequence space to variants with the desired functions.},

For the analysis, both authors' and other published data were used. It was shown that active site mutations that resulted in spectral shifts of bioluminescence as a rule caused substantial decrease in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. At the same time, mutations in the conservative regions of the protein amino acid sequence that were in the periphery of the protein globe resulted in red shift of the bioluminescence spectra without affecting catalytic activity. Correlation was observed between the value of spectral shift and polarizability of the introduced amino acid residue: the higher the polarizability, the larger was the red shift of bioluminescence.},

abstract = {Fluorescence of luciferases from Luciola mingrelica (single tryptophan residue, Trp-419) and Photinus pyralis (two tryptophan residues, Trp-417, Trp-426) was studied. Analysis of quenching of tryptophan fluorescence showed that the tryptophan residue conserved in all luciferases is not accessible for charged quenchers, which is explained by the presence of positively and negatively charged amino acid residues in the close vicinity to it. An effective energy transfer from tryptophan to luciferin was observed during quenching of tryptophan fluorescence of both luciferases with luciferin. From the data on the energy transfer, the distance between the luciferin molecule and Trp-417 (419) in the luciferin luciferase complex was calculated: 11-15 A for P. pyralis and 12-17 A for L. mingrelica luciferases. The role of the conserved Trp residue in the catalysis is discussed.},

A component of this material, N-acetyl-muramic acid (NAM), serves as a core structural element for innate immune recognition of PG fragments. We report the synthesis of modifiable NAM carbohydrate derivatives and the installation of these building blocks into the backbone of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial PG utilizing metabolic cell wall recycling and biosynthetic machineries. Whole cells are labelled via click chemistry and visualized using super-resolution microscopy, revealing higher resolution PG structural details and allowing the cell wall biosynthesis, as well as its destruction in immune cells, to be tracked. This study will assist in the future identification of mechanisms that the immune system uses to recognize bacteria, glean information about fundamental cell wall architecture and aid in the design of novel antibiotics.},

abstract = {Beetle luciferases catalyze a two-step reaction that includes the initial adenylation of the luciferin substrate, followed by an oxidative decarboxylation that ultimately produces light. Evidence for homologous acyl-CoA synthetases supports a domain alternation catalytic mechanism in which these enzymes' C-terminal domain rotates by {\textasciitilde}140{\textdegree} to adopt two conformations that are used to catalyze the two partial reactions. While many structures exist of acyl-CoA synthetases in both conformations, to date only biochemical evidence supports domain alternation with luciferase. We have determined the structure of a cross-linked luciferase enzyme that is trapped in the second conformation. This new structure supports the role of the second catalytic conformation and provides insights into the biochemical mechanism of the luciferase oxidative step.},

Bioluminescence imaging with luciferase-luciferin pairs is sufficiently sensitive to image cells in vivo but lacks the spatial resolution to identify cellular locations and interactions. To repurpose this technology for visualizing cellular networks, we developed a "caged" luciferin that produces light only when cells are in close contact. This molecule comprises a nitroaromatic core that can be selectively reduced ("uncaged") by one cell type, liberating a luciferin that can be selectively consumed by neighboring, luciferase-expressing cells. When the two cell types are in contact, robust light emission is observed. This imaging strategy will enable the noninvasive visualization of cell-cell interactions relevant to organismal biology.},

The large hydrophobic amino acid p-benzoyl phenylalanine (pBzF) was substituted for Tyr72, which led to a catalytically inactive protein. A library of five residues (Leu25', Arg29', Leu76, Ile80' and Asp83') surrounding pBzF72 was generated and subjected to a growth based selection in a chorismate mutase deficient strain. An EcCM variant (Phe25', pBzF72, Thr76, Gly80' and Tyr83') forms a stable homodimer, has catalytic activity similar to the wild type enzyme, and unfolds with a Tm of 53 {\textdegree}C. The X-ray crystal structure reveals a pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions that stabilize the new protein interface. The strategy described here should be useful for generating organisms that are dependent on the presence of a ncAA for growth.},

abstract = {Engineered alphavirus vectors expressing reporters of infection have been used for a number of years due to their relatively low costs for analysis of virus replication and the capacity to utilize imaging systems for longitudinal measurements of growth within single animals. In general, these vectors have been derived from Old World alphaviruses using a second viral subgenomic promoter to express the transgenes, placed either immediately after the nonstructural proteins or at the 3' end of the viral coding sequences. However, the relevance of these vectors to natural infections is questionable, as they have not been rigorously tested for virulence in vivo in comparison with parental viruses or for the retention of the reporter during replication. Here, we report construction of new expression vectors for two Old World arthritogenic alphaviruses (Sindbis and Chikungunya viruses) and two New World encephalitic alphaviruses (eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses) based upon either fusion of the reporter protein in frame within nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) or insertion of the reporter as a cleavable element between the capsid and PE2 structural proteins. We have compared these with a traditional 3' double subgenomic promoter virus expressing either a large, firefly luciferase (fLuc; 1,650 nucleotides), or small, NanoLuc (nLuc; 513 nucleotides), luminescent reporter protein. Results indicate that the nLuc is substantially more stable than fLuc during repeated rounds of infection regardless of the transgene location. However, the capsid-PE2 insertion and nsP3 fusion viruses exhibit the most authentic mimicking of parental virus infection regardless of expressed protein. IMPORTANCE As more antiviral therapeutics and vaccines are developed, rapid and accurate in vivo modeling of their efficacy will be required. However, current alphavirus vectors expressing reporters of infection have not been extensively tested for accurate mimicking of the infection characteristics of unmodified parental viruses. Additionally, use of in vivo imaging systems detecting light emitted from luciferase reporters can significantly decrease costs associated with efficacy studies by minimizing numbers of animals. Herein we report development and testing of new expression vectors for Sindbis, Chikungunya, and eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses and demonstrate that a small (∼500-nucleotide) reporter gene (NanoLuc; Promega) is very stable and causes a disease severity similar to that caused by unmodified parental viruses. In contrast, expression of larger reporters is very rapidly lost with virus replication and can be significantly attenuating. The utility of NanoLuc for in vivo imaging is also demonstrated.},

abstract = {<h2>Summary</h2><p>Numerous near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent proteins (FPs) were recently engineered from bacterial photoreceptors but lack of their systematic comparison makes researcher's choice rather difficult. Here we evaluated side-by-side several modern NIR FPs, such as blue-shifted smURFP and miRFP670, and red-shifted mIFP and miRFP703. We found that among all NIR FPs, miRFP670 had the highest fluorescence intensity in various mammalian cells. For instance, in common HeLa cells miRFP703, mIFP, and smURFP were 2-, 9-, and 53-fold dimmer than miRFP670. Either co-expression of heme oxygenase or incubation of cells with heme precursor weakly affected NIR fluorescence, however, in the latter case elevated cellular autofluorescence. Exogenously added chromophore substantially increased smURFP brightness but only slightly enhanced brightness of other NIR FPs. mIFP showed intermediate, while monomeric miRFP670 and miRFP703 exhibited high binding efficiency of endogenous biliverdin chromophore. This feature makes them easy to use as GFP-like proteins for spectral multiplexing with FPs of visible range.</p>},

abstract = {Small molecules play essential roles in organisms, and so methods to sense these molecules within living cells could have wide-ranging uses in both biology and biotechnology. However, current methods for making new {\textquotedblleft}biosensors{\textquotedblright} are limited and only a narrow range of small molecules can be detected. One approach to biosensor design in yeast and other eukaryotic organisms uses proteins called ligand-binding domains, which bind to small molecules. Here, Feng, Jester, Tinberg, Mandell et al. have developed a new method to make biosensors from ligand-binding domains that could, in principle, be applied to any target small molecule. The new method involves taking a ligand-binding domain that is either engineered or occurs in nature and linking it to something that can be readily detected, such as a protein that fluoresces or that controls gene expression. This combined biosensor protein is then engineered, via mutations, such that it is unstable unless it binds to the small molecule. This means that, in the absence of the small molecule, these proteins are destroyed inside living cells. However, the binding of a target molecule to one of these proteins protects it from degradation, which allows the signal to be detected. Feng, Jester, Tinberg, Mandell et al. use this method to create biosensors for a human hormone called progesterone and a drug called digoxin, which is used to treat heart disease. Further experiments used the biosensors to optimize the production of progesterone in yeast and to regulate the activity of a gene editing protein called Cas9 in human cells. The biosensors can be also used to produce long-term environmental sensors in plant cells. This approach makes it possible to produce a wide variety of biosensors for different organisms. The next step is to continue to explore the ability of various proteins to be converted into biosensors, and to find out how easy it is to transfer a biosensor produced in one species to another.},

A newly synthesized C2-modified trifluoromethyl analog cf3-v-CTZ showed slightly more red-shifted luminescence than v-CTZ when it was used as a substrate for Renilla luciferases.},

abstract = {Cells receive many signals from their environment, for example, when they are compressed or pulled about by neighboring cells. Information about these {\textquoteleft}mechanical stimuli{\textquoteright} can be transmitted within the cell to trigger changes in gene expression and cell behavior. When a cell receives a mechanical stimulus, it can activate the release of calcium ions from storage compartments within the cell, including from a compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum. Calcium ions can also enter the cell from outside via channels located in the membrane that surrounds the cell (the plasma membrane). Kim et al. investigated how mechanical forces are transmitted in a type of human cell called mesenchymal stem cells using optical tweezers to apply a gentle force to the outside of a cell. These tweezers use a laser to attract tiny objects, in this case a bead attached to proteins in the cell's outer membrane. The cell's response to this mechanical stimulation was measured using a sensor protein that fluoresces a different color when it binds to calcium ions. With this set-up, Kim et al. found that mesenchymal stem cells are able to transmit mechanical forces to different depths within the cell. The forces can travel deep to trigger the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum. This process involves a network of protein fibers that criss-cross to support the structure of a cell{\textemdash}called the cytoskeleton{\textemdash}and also requires proteins that are associated with the cytoskeleton to contract. However, calcium ion entry through the plasma membrane due to a mechanical force does not require these contractile proteins{\textemdash}only the cytoskeleton is involved. These results demonstrate that the transmission of mechanical signals to different depths within mesenchymal stem cells involves different components. Future work should shed light on how these mechanical signals control gene expression and the development of mesenchymal stem cells.},

ANG also promotes neovascularization, and can induce hemorrhage and encourage tumor growth. The causal neurodegeneration of ALS is associated with reactive oxygen species, which are also known to elicit the oxidative cleavage of carbon-boron bonds. We have developed a synthetic boronic acid mask that restrains the ribonucleolytic activity of ANG. The masked ANG does not stimulate endothelial cell proliferation but protects astrocytes from oxidative stress. By differentiating between the two dichotomous biological activities of ANG, this strategy could provide a viable pharmacological approach for the treatment of ALS.},

abstract = {Bioluminescence imaging is a powerful approach for visualizing specific events occurring inside live mice. Animals can be made to glow in response to the expression of a gene, the activity of an enzyme, or the growth of a tumor. But bioluminescence requires the interaction of a luciferase enzyme with a small-molecule luciferin, and its scope has been limited by the mere handful of natural combinations. Herein, we show that mutants of firefly luciferase can discriminate between natural and synthetic substrates in the brains of live mice. When using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to express luciferases in the brain, we found that mutant luciferases that are inactive or weakly active with d-luciferin can light up brightly when treated with the aminoluciferins CycLuc1 and CycLuc2 or their respective FAAH-sensitive luciferin amides. Further development of selective luciferases promises to expand the power of bioluminescence and allow multiple events to be imaged in the same live animal.},

abstract = {Mucins are a family of secreted and transmembrane glycoproteins characterized by a massive domain of dense O-glycosylation on serine and threonine residues. Mucins are intimately involved in immunity and cancer, yet elucidation of the biological roles of their glycodomains has been complicated by their massive size, domain polymorphisms, and variable glycosylation patterns. Here we developed a synthetic route to a library of compositionally defined, high-molecular weight, dual end-functionalized mucin glycodomain constructs via N-carboxyanhydride polymerization. These glycopolypeptides are the first synthetic analogs to our knowledge to feature the native $\alpha$-GalNAc linkage to serine with molecular weights similar to native mucins, solving a nearly 50-year synthetic challenge. Physical characterization of the mimics revealed insights into the structure and properties of mucins. The synthetic glycodomains were end-functionalized with an optical probe and a tetrazine moiety, which allowed site-specific bioorthogonal conjugation to an engineered membrane protein on live mammalian cells. This strategy in protein engineering will open avenues to explore the biological roles of cell surface mucins.},

abstract = {<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3> <p>The microbes that live in and on our bodies (the human microbiome) profoundly affect human health and disease. For example, within the lower gastrointestinal tract, microbes employ powerful enzymatic chemistry to access recalcitrant nutrients and generate metabolites that mediate interactions with host cells. Given the vast amounts of available sequencing data from human microbiomes, we know surprisingly little about the precise mechanisms by which these activities influence human biology. This knowledge gap arises in part from our poor understanding of microbial enzymes and metabolic processes. Collectively, the genes present in microbiomes (metagenomes) encode millions of uncharacterized enzymes, and approaches are needed to connect these genes to biochemical functions.</p><h3>RATIONALE</h3> <p>Efforts to identify the microbial activities encoded within metagenomes (functional profiling) have largely focused on assigning protein sequences found in these data sets to overarching processes (e.g., {\textquotedblleft}vitamin biosynthesis{\textquotedblright}) or large enzyme superfamilies whose members carry out many different chemical reactions. These methods therefore provide limited information about specific enzymes of interest and cannot easily differentiate superfamily members with known and unknown functions. Addressing this problem requires incorporating a mechanistic understanding of how amino acid sequence influences enzymatic activity into metagenomic analyses. We envisioned developing a {\textquotedblleft}chemically guided{\textquotedblright} functional profiling strategy that would use protein sequence similarity network (SSN) analysis to distinguish functionally distinct members of large enzyme superfamilies and integrate this information into quantitative metagenomics. This method would not only quantify different types of enzymes in metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data sets, but also pinpoint enzymes of unknown function in communities, prioritizing them for further study on the basis of their abundance and distribution. We initially applied this workflow to profile the glycyl radical enzyme (GRE) superfamily, which is one of the most enriched protein families in the human gut microbiome. GREs are O<sub>2</sub>-sensitive enzymes that catalyze key transformations in anaerobic microbial metabolism, including carbohydrate utilization and DNA synthesis. Although the activities of certain gut microbial GREs have been connected to heart, liver, and kidney diseases, as well as autism, numerous members of this superfamily have not yet been biochemically characterized. </p><h3>RESULTS</h3> <p>We determined the abundance of individual types of GREs in 378 metagenomes from healthy humans, including two aerobic body sites (vagina and skin), three microaerobic body sites (tongue, inner cheek, and dental plaque), and one anaerobic body site (gut). The human gut microbiome contained the largest number of distinct GREs, many of which have unknown functions. Our analysis provided new information about known GRE-mediated activities, including production of the disease-associated metabolites trimethylamine and <i>p</i>-cresol. In vitro studies of abundant, uncharacterized GREs from the human gut revealed that radical-based dehydration chemistry is widespread in this environment and led to the discovery of <i>trans</i>-4-hydroxy-l-proline (Hyp) dehydratase. This enzyme enables gut commensals and human pathogens like <i>Clostridium difficile</i> to metabolize Hyp, a nonproteinogenic amino acid that is rare in bacteria but is an abundant posttranslational modification in eukaryotes. The universal distribution of this activity in human gut microbiomes suggests that it plays an important role in this habitat, setting the stage for future hypothesis-driven research.</p><h3>CONCLUSION</h3> <p>By accurately identifying enzymes present in microbial communities, this workflow allows ecological context to inform enzyme characterization, uncovering widespread but previously unappreciated metabolic activities. We are now poised to apply this strategy to examine various patient populations, additional protein superfamilies, and other microbiomes.</p>},

abstract = {Under physiological conditions firefly luciferase catalyzes the highly efficient emission of yellow-green light from the substrates luciferin, Mg-ATP, and oxygen. In nature, bioluminescence emission by beetle luciferases is observed in colors ranging from green (approximately 530 nm) to red (approximately 635 nm), yet all known luciferases use the same luciferin substrate. In an earlier report [Branchini, B. R., Magyar, R. M., Murtiashaw, M. H., Anderson, S. M., and Zimmer, M. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 15311-15319], we described the effects of mutations at His245 on luciferase activity. In the context of molecular modeling results, we proposed that His245 is located at the luciferase active site. We noted too that the H245 mutants displayed red-shifted bioluminescent emission spectra. We report here the construction and purification of additional His245 mutants, as well as mutants at residues Lys529 and Thr343, all of which are stringently conserved in the beetle luciferase sequences. Analysis of specific activity and steady-state kinetic constants suggested that these residues are involved in luciferase catalysis and the productive binding of substrates. Bioluminescence emission spectroscopy studies indicated that point mutations at His245 and Thr343 produced luciferases that emitted light over the color range from green to red. The results of mutational and biochemical studies with luciferase reported here have enabled us to propose speculative mechanisms for color determination in firefly bioluminescence. An essential role for Thr343, the participation of His245 and Arg218, and the involvement of bound AMP are indicated.},

abstract = {Citrullination, which is catalyzed by protein arginine deiminases (PADs 1{\textendash}4 and 6), is a post-translational modification (PTM) that effectively neutralizes the positive charge of a guanidinium group by its replacement with a neutral urea. Given the sequence similarity of PAD2 across mammalian species and the genomic organization of the PAD2 gene, PAD2 is predicted to be the ancestral homologue of the PADs. Although PAD2 has long been known to play a role in myelination, it has only recently been linked to other cellular processes, including gene transcription and macrophage extracellular trap formation. For example, PAD2 deiminates histone H3 at R26, and this PTM leads to the increased transcription of more than 200 genes under the control of the estrogen receptor. Given that our understanding of PAD2 biology remains incomplete, we initiated mechanistic studies on this enzyme to aid the development of PAD2-specific inhibitors. Herein, we report that the substrate specificity and calcium dependence of PAD2...},

abstract = {We have designed a modular protein tagging system that allows different functionalities to be linked onto a single genetic fusion, either in solution, in living cells, or in chemically fixed cells. The protein tag (HaloTag) is a modified haloalkane dehalogenase designed to covalently bind to synthetic ligands (HaloTag ligands). The synthetic ligands comprise a chloroalkane linker attached to a variety of useful molecules, such as fluorescent dyes, affinity handles, or solid surfaces. Covalent bond formation between the protein tag and the chloroalkane linker is highly specific, occurs rapidly under physiological conditions, and is essentially irreversible. We demonstrate the utility of this system for cellular imaging and protein immobilization by analyzing multiple molecular processes associated with NF-kappaB-mediated cellular physiology, including imaging of subcellular protein translocation and capture of protein--protein and protein--DNA complexes.},

abstract = {Light emission from the North American firefly Photinus pyralis, which emits yellow-green (557-nm) light, is widely believed to be the most efficient bioluminescence system known, making this luciferase an excellent tool for monitoring gene expression. We present studies on the production of a set of thermostable red- and green-emitting luciferase mutants with bioluminescent properties suitable for dual-color reporter assays, biosensor measurements with internal controls, and imaging techniques. Starting with the luciferase variant Ser284Thr, we introduced the mutations Thr214Ala, Ala215Leu, Ile232Ala, Phe295Leu, and Glu354Lys to produce a new red-emitting enzyme with a bioluminescence maximum of 610 nm, narrow emission bandwidth, favorable kinetic properties, and excellent thermostability at 37 degrees C. By adding the same five changes to luciferase mutant Val241Ile/Gly246Ala/Phe250Ser, we produced a protein with an emission maximum of 546 nm, providing a set of thermostable enzymes whose bioluminescence maxima were separated by 64 nm. Model studies established that the luciferases could be detected at the attomole level and six orders of magnitude higher. In microplate luminometer format, mixtures containing 1.0 fmol total luciferase were quantified from measurements of simultaneously emitted red and green light. The results presented here provide evidence that it is feasible to monitor two distinct activities at 37 degrees C with these novel thermostable proteins.},

abstract = { High nucleophilic reactivity and functional group tolerance are opposing properties of organometallic compounds. While organolithium compounds are highly nucleophilic and, therefore, react with most electrophiles, organosilicon compounds are on the low-reactivity end of the nucleophilicity scale. They tolerate numerous electrophilic functional groups and often require (Lewis) base activation in order to react. Organoboron compounds, which are key intermediates in organic synthesis, are positioned in between. While some of them undergo non-catalysed C{\textendash}C bond forming reactions with various electrophiles, others tolerate a variety of functional groups and are most valuable substrates for Pd-catalysed cross-couplings (Suzuki{\textendash}Miyaura reactions). As it is difficult for the preparative chemist to decide which functional groups are tolerated and which do react with organoboron reagents in the absence of a catalyst, we established a quantitative reactivity scale for representatives of the most important classes of organoboron reagents and we applied these data for predicting the feasibility of transition metal-free C{\textendash}C bond forming reactions.},

abstract = {Natural modifications of peptidoglycan modulate the innate immune response. Peptidoglycan derivatives activate this response via the intracellular innate immune receptor, Nod2. To probe how these modifications alter the response, a novel and efficient carbohydrate synthesis was developed to allow for late-stage modification of the amine at the 2-position. Modification of the carbohydrate was found to be important for stabilizing Nod2 and generating the proper response. The native Nod2 ligands demonstrate a significant increase in the cellular stability of Nod2. Moreover, changing the identity of the natural ligands at the carbohydrate 2-position allows for the Nod2-dependent immune response to be either up-regulated or down-regulated. The ligand structure can be adjusted to tune the Nod2 response, suggesting that other innate immune receptors and their ligands could use a similar strategy.},

The rice receptor kinase XA21, which confers robust resistance to most strains of the Gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae ( Xoo ), is representative of a large class of cell surface immune receptors in plants and animals. We report the identification of a previously undescribed Xoo protein, called RaxX, which is required for activation of XA21-mediated immunity. Xoo strains that lack RaxX, or carry mutations in the single RaxX tyrosine residue (Y41), are able to evade XA21-mediated immunity. Y41 of RaxX is sulfated by the prokaryotic tyrosine sulfotransferase RaxST. Sulfated, but not nonsulfated, RaxX triggers hallmarks of the plant immune response in an XA21-dependent manner. A sulfated, 21{\textendash}amino acid synthetic RaxX peptide (RaxX21-sY) is sufficient for this activity. Xoo field isolates that overcome XA21-mediated immunity encode an alternate raxX allele, suggesting that coevolutionary interactions between host and pathogen contribute to RaxX diversification. RaxX is highly conserved in many plant pathogenic Xanthomonas species. The new insights gained from the discovery and characterization of the sulfated protein, RaxX, can be applied to the development of resistant crop varieties and therapeutic reagents that have the potential to block microbial infection of both plants and animals.},

abstract = {Saturation mutagenesis is employed in protein engineering and genome-editing efforts to generate libraries that span amino acid design space. Traditionally, this is accomplished by using degenerate/compressed codons such as NNK (N = A/C/G/T, K = G/T), which covers all amino acids and one stop codon. These solutions suffer from two types of redundancy: (a) different codons for the same amino acid lead to bias, and (b) wild type amino acid is included within the library. These redundancies increase library size and downstream screening efforts. Here, we present a dynamic approach to compress codons for any desired list of amino acids, taking into account codon usage. This results in a unique codon collection for every amino acid to be mutated, with the desired redundancy level. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach can be used to design precise oligo libraries amendable to recombineering and CRISPR-based genome editing to obtain a diverse population with high efficiency.},

abstract = {Lactic acid bacteria are found in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals and have received tremendous attention due to their health-promoting properties. We report the development of two dual-color luciferase-producing Lactobacillus (Lb.) plantarum and Lactococcus (Lc.) lactis strains for noninvasive simultaneous tracking in the mouse gastrointestinal tract. We previously described the functional expression of the red luciferase mutant (CBRluc) from Pyrophorus plagiophthalamus in Lb. plantarum NCIMB8826 and Lc. lactis MG1363 (C. Daniel, S. Poiret, V. Dennin, D. Boutillier, and B. Pot, Appl Environ Microbiol 79:1086-1094, 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.03221-12). In this study, we determined that CBRluc is a better-performing luciferase for in vivo localization of both lactic acid bacteria after oral administration than the green click beetle luciferase mutant construct developed in this study. We further established the possibility to simultaneously detect red- and green-emitting lactic acid bacteria by dual-wavelength bioluminescence imaging in combination with spectral unmixing. The difference in spectra of light emission by the red and green click beetle luciferase mutants and dual bioluminescence detection allowed in vitro and in vivo quantification of the red and green emitted signals; thus, it allowed us to monitor the dynamics and fate of the two bacterial populations simultaneously. Persistence and viability of both strains simultaneously administered to mice in different ratios was studied in vivo in anesthetized mice and ex vivo in mouse feces. The application of dual-luciferase-labeled bacteria has considerable potential to simultaneously study the interactions and potential competitions of different targeted bacteria and their hosts.},

abstract = {Living organisms produce hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) to kill invading pathogens and for cellular signaling, but aberrant generation of this reactive oxygen species is a hallmark of oxidative stress and inflammation in aging, injury, and disease. The effects of H(2)O(2) on the overall health of living animals remain elusive, in part owing to a dearth of methods for studying this transient small molecule in vivo. Here we report the design, synthesis, and in vivo applications of Peroxy Caged Luciferin-1 (PCL-1), a chemoselective bioluminescent probe for the real-time detection of H(2)O(2) within living animals. PCL-1 is a boronic acid-caged firefly luciferin molecule that selectively reacts with H(2)O(2) to release firefly luciferin, which triggers a bioluminescent response in the presence of firefly luciferase. The high sensitivity and selectivity of PCL-1 for H(2)O(2), combined with the favorable properties of bioluminescence for in vivo imaging, afford a unique technology for real-time detection of basal levels of H(2)O(2) generated in healthy, living mice. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of PCL-1 for monitoring physiological fluctuations in H(2)O(2) levels by directly imaging elevations in H(2)O(2) within testosterone-stimulated tumor xenografts in vivo. The ability to chemoselectively monitor H(2)O(2) fluxes in real time in living animals offers opportunities to dissect H(2)O(2)'s disparate contributions to health, aging, and disease.},

A longstanding limitation for using chemical compounds in complex tissues has been the inability to target bioactive small molecules to a specific cell class. Here, we describe a generalizable esterase-ester pair capable of targeted delivery of small molecules to living cells and tissue with cellular specificity. We used fluorogenic molecules to rapidly identify a small ester masking motif that is stable to endogenous esterases, but is efficiently removed by an exogenous esterase. This strategy allows facile targeting of dyes and drugs in complex biological environments to label specific cell types, illuminate gap junction connectivity, and pharmacologically perturb distinct subsets of cells. We expect this approach to have general utility for the specific delivery of many small molecules to defined cellular populations.},

Using new algorithms that rely on hashing techniques to construct active sites for multistep reactions, we designed retro-aldolases that use four different catalytic motifs to catalyze the breaking of a carbon-carbon bond in a nonnatural substrate. Of the 72 designs that were experimentally characterized, 32, spanning a range of protein folds, had detectable retro-aldolase activity. Designs that used an explicit water molecule to mediate proton shuffling were significantly more successful, with rate accelerations of up to four orders of magnitude and multiple turnovers, than those involving charged side-chain networks. The atomic accuracy of the design process was confirmed by the x-ray crystal structure of active designs embedded in two protein scaffolds, both of which were nearly superimposable on the design model.},

abstract = {Macrocycles are appealing drug candidates due to their high affinity, specificity, and favorable pharmacological properties. In this study, we explored the effects of chemical modifications to a natural product macrocycle upon its activity, 3D geometry, and conformational entropy. We chose thiocillin as a model system, a thiopeptide in the ribosomally encoded family of natural products that exhibits potent antimicrobial effects against Gram-positive bacteria. Since thiocillin is derived from a genetically encoded peptide scaffold, site-directed mutagenesis allows for rapid generation of analogues. To understand thiocillin{\textquoteright}s structure{\textendash}activity relationship, we generated a site-saturation mutagenesis library covering each position along thiocillin{\textquoteright}s macrocyclic ring. We report the identification of eight unique compounds more potent than wild-type thiocillin, the best having an 8-fold improvement in potency.

abstract = {Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) systems to date have been dominated by use of blue-green Renilla luciferase (Rluc) as the energy donor. Although effective in many cases, the expense and unfavorable biochemical attributes of the substrate (phenylcoelenterazine) limit utility of Rluc-based BRET systems. Herein we report a series of novel BRET pairs based on luciferases that utilize D-luciferin, resulting in red-shifted photonic outputs, favorable biochemical attributes, and increased efficacy. We developed a modified F{\"o}rster equation to predict optimal BRET luciferase donor-fluorophore pairs and identified tdTomato as the optimal red fluorophore acceptor for click beetle green luciferase (CBG). A prototypical single-chain protease biosensor, capable of reporting on executioner caspase activity in live cells and in real-time, was generated by inserting a DEVD linker between CBG and tdTomato and validated in vitro with recombinant caspases and in cellulo with apoptosis-sensitive and -resistant cell lines. High signal-to-noise ratios ( approximately 33) and Z' factors (0.85) were observed in live cell longitudinal studies, sufficient for high-throughput screening. Thus, we illustrate a general methodology for the rational design of new BRET systems and provide a novel single-chain BRET protease biosensor that is long lived, red-shifted, and utilizes D-luciferin.},

We report the identification of novel luciferase mutants which combine improved pH-tolerance and thermostability and that retain the specific activity of the wild-type enzyme. These were identified by the mutagenesis of solvent-exposed non-conserved hydrophobic amino acids to hydrophilic residues in Photinus pyralis firefly luciferase followed by in vivo activity screening. Mutants F14R, L35Q, V182K, I232K and F465R were found to be the preferred substitutions at the respective positions. The effects of these amino acid replacements are additive, since combination of the five substitutions produced an enzyme with greatly improved pH-tolerance and stability up to 45 degrees C. All mutants, including the mutant with all five substitutions, showed neither a decrease in specific activity relative to the recombinant wild-type enzyme, nor any substantial differences in kinetic constants. It is envisaged that the combined mutant will be superior to wild-type luciferase for many in vitro and in vivo applications.},

All Alexa dyes and their conjugates are more fluorescent and more photostable than their commonly used spectral analogues listed above. In addition, Alexa dyes are insensitive to pH in the 4-10 range. We evaluated Alexa dyes compared with conventional dyes in applications using various conjugates, including those of goat anti-mouse IgG (GAM), streptavidin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and concanavalin A (ConA). Conjugates of Alexa 546 are at least twofold more fluorescent than Cy3 conjugates. Proteins labeled with the Alexa 568 or Alexa 594 dyes are several-fold brighter than the same proteins labeled with lissamine rhodamine B or Texas Red dyes, respectively. Alexa dye derivatives of phalloidin stain F-actin with high specificity. Hydrazide forms of the Alexa dyes are very bright, formaldehyde-fixable polar tracers. Conjugates of the Alexa 430 (ex 430 nm/em 520 nm) and Alexa 532 (ex 530 nm/em 548 nm) fluorochromes are spectrally unique fluorescent probes, with relatively high quantum yields in their excitation and emission wavelength ranges.},

abstract = {Previously, we reported a new method for intracellular protein labeling in living cells called PRIME (probe incorporation mediated by enzymes). PRIME uses a mutant of Escherichia coli lipoic acid ligase (LplA) to catalyze covalent probe ligation onto a 13-amino acid peptide recognition sequence. While our first demonstration labeled proteins with a coumarin fluorophore, subsequent engineering produced alkyl azide and trans-cyclooctene ligases as well as an interaction-dependent form of the coumarin PRIME method (ID-PRIME). One major limitation of the PRIME methodologies is that LplA mutants have very low activity in the secretory pathway. Here, we extend PRIME labeling to oxidizing compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell surface.

abstract = {2-Cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole is the key intermediate for the synthesis of d-luciferin, the natural substrate of firefly luciferases. A new synthesis of 2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole has been realized starting from the reaction of 1,4-benzoquinone with l-cysteine ethyl ester, followed by oxidation-cyclization of the intermediate ethyl (R)-2-amino-3-(2,5-dihydroxyphenylsulfanyl)propan{\-}oate hydrochloride to 2-carbethoxy-6-hydroxybenzothiazole. A suitable protection of this intermediate and a conversion to the corresponding nitrile gave, after deprotection, 2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole (32% yield from 1,4-benzoquinone). This nitrile reacts with d-cysteine to afford d-luciferin at room temperature in nearly quantitative yield (90-95%).},

We propose a new design strategy (designated as bioluminescent enzyme-induced electron transfer: BioLeT) for luciferin-based bioluminescence probes. Luminescence measurements of a series of aminoluciferin (AL) derivatives confirmed that bioluminescence can be controlled by means of BioLeT. Based on this concept, we developed bioluminescence probes for nitric oxide (NO) that enabled quantitative and sensitive detection even in vivo. Our design strategy should be applicable to develop a wide range of practically useful bioluminogenic probes.},

abstract = {Protein methyltransferase (PMT)-mediated posttranslational modification of histone and nonhistone substrates modulates stability, localization, and interacting partners of target proteins in diverse cellular contexts. These events play critical roles in normal biological processes and are frequently deregulated in human diseases. In the course of identifying substrates of individual PMTs, bioorthogonal profiling of protein methylation (BPPM) has demonstrated its merits. In this approach, specific PMTs are engineered to process S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) analogs as cofactor surrogates and label their substrates with distinct chemical modifications for target elucidation. Despite the proof-of-concept advancement of BPPM, few efforts have been made to explore its generality. With two cancer-relevant PMTs, EuHMT1 (GLP1/KMT1D) and EuHMT2 (G9a/KMT1C), as models, we defined the key structural features of engineered PMTs and matched SAM analogs that can render the orthogonal enzyme-cofactor pairs for efficient catalysis. Here we have demonstrated that the presence of sulfonium-$\beta$-sp(2) carbon and flexible, medium-sized sulfonium-$\delta$-substituents are crucial for SAM analogs as BPPM reagents. The bulky cofactors can be accommodated by tailoring the conserved Y1211/Y1154 residues and nearby hydrophobic cavities of EuHMT1/2. Profiling proteome-wide substrates with BPPM allowed identification of >500 targets of EuHMT1/2 with representative targets validated using native EuHMT1/2 and SAM. This finding indicates that EuHMT1/2 may regulate many cellular events previously unrecognized to be modulated by methylation. The present work, therefore, paves the way to a broader application of the BPPM technology to profile methylomes of diverse PMTs and elucidate their downstream functions.},

Using new algorithms that rely on hashing techniques to construct active sites for multistep reactions, we designed retro-aldolases that use four different catalytic motifs to catalyze the breaking of a carbon-carbon bond in a nonnatural substrate. Of the 72 designs that were experimentally characterized, 32, spanning a range of protein folds, had detectable retro-aldolase activity. Designs that used an explicit water molecule to mediate proton shuffling were significantly more successful, with rate accelerations of up to four orders of magnitude and multiple turnovers, than those involving charged side-chain networks. The atomic accuracy of the design process was confirmed by the x-ray crystal structure of active designs embedded in two protein scaffolds, both of which were nearly superimposable on the design model.},

In addition to being used as a bioorthogonal ligation handle, an infrared probe and a photo-affinity reagent, PABK was shown to be chemically decaged by trans-cyclooctenols via a strain-promoted 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, which provides a new bioorthogonal cleavage strategy for intracellular protein activation. The biocompatibility and efficiency of this method were demonstrated by decaging of a PABK-caged firefly luciferase under living conditions. We further extended this method to chemically rescue a bacterial toxin OspF inside mammalian host cells.},

Here, we show that cancer cells resistant to Hsp70 inhibitors in vitro remain sensitive to them in vivo, revealing the pathogenic significance of Hsp70 in tumor stromal cells rather than tumor cells as widely presumed. Using transgenic mouse models of cancer, we found that expression of Hsp70 in host stromal cells was essential to support tumor growth. Furthermore, genetic ablation or pharmacologic inhibition of Hsp70 suppressed tumor infiltration by macrophages needed to enable tumor growth. Overall, our results illustrate how Hsp70 inhibitors mediate the anticancer effects by targeting both tumor cells and tumor stromal cells, with implications for the broad use of these inhibitors as tools to ablate tumor-associated macrophages that enable malignant progression.

abstract = {Unnatural amino acid 2 (5-HO2CCONH-2-MeO-C6H3-CONHNH2) duplicates the hydrogen-bonding functionality of one edge of a tripeptide $\beta$-strand. It is composed of hydrazine, 5-amino-2-methoxybenzoic acid, and oxalic acid groups and is designated by the three-letter abbreviation {\textquotedblleft}Hao{\textquotedblright} to reflect these three components. The 2,7-di-tert-butylfluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc*)- and tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)-protected derivatives of Hao are prepared efficiently and in high yield by the condensation of suitably protected derivatives of hydrazine, 5-amino-2-methoxybenzoic acid, and oxalic acid. Fmoc*-Hao and Boc-Hao behave like typical Fmoc- and Boc-protected amino acids and can be incorporated into peptides by standard solid- and solution-phase peptide synthesis techniques using carbodiimide coupling agents. Hao-containing peptide 9 (i-PrCO-Phe-Hao-Val-NHBu) forms a $\beta$-sheetlike hydrogen-bonded dimer in CDCl3 and CD3OD{\textminus}CDCl3 solutions.

The enzyme first catalyzes the adenylation of the carboxylate substrate luciferin with Mg-ATP followed by the oxidation of the acyl-adenylate to the light-emitting oxyluciferin product. The beetle luciferases are members of a large family of nonbioluminescent proteins that catalyze reactions of ATP with carboxylate substrates to form acyl-adenylates. Formation of the luciferase{\textminus}luciferyl{\textminus}AMP complex is a specific example of the chemistry common to this enzyme family. Site-directed mutants at positions Lys529, Thr343, and His245 were studied to determine the effects of the amino acid changes at these positions on the individual luciferase-catalyzed adenylation and oxidation reactions. The results suggest that Lys529 is a critical residue for effective substrate orientation and that it provides favorable polar interactions important for transition state st...},

In eukaryotes, this process is performed by a self-organized structure called the mitotic spindle. It has long been appreciated that mechanical forces must be applied to chromosomes. At the same time, the network of microtubules in the spindle must be able to apply and sustain large forces to maintain spindle integrity. Here we consider recent efforts to measure forces generated within microtubule networks by ensembles of key proteins. New findings, such as length-dependent force generation, protein clustering by asymmetric friction, and entropic expansion forces will help advance models of force generation needed for spindle function and maintaining integrity.},

They may be single- or multiwalled (SWCNTs and MWCNTs respectively). Since the seminal report of their synthesis in 1991, CNTs have fascinated scientists of all stripes. Physicists have been intrigued by their electrical, thermal, and vibrational potential. Materials scientists have worked on integrating them into ultrastrong composites and electronic devices, while chemists have been fascinated by the effects of curvature on reactivity and have developed new synthesis and purification techniques. However, to date no large-scale, real-life biotechnological CNT breakthrough has been industrially adopted and it is proving difficult to justify taking these materials forward into the clinic. We believe that these challenges are not the end of the story, but that a viable carbon nanotube biotechnology is one in which the ...},

D-Luciferin can be replaced by synthetic luciferin analogues that increase near-infrared photon flux >10-fold over that of D-luciferin in live luciferase-expressing cells. Firefly luciferase can be mutated to accept and utilize rigid aminoluciferins with high activity in both live and lysed cells yet exhibit 10,000-fold selectivity over the natural luciferase substrate. These new luciferin analogues thus pave the way to an extended family of bioluminescent reporters.},

Investigations on Gs-coupled receptors would benefit from a second messenger assay that allows continuous monitoring of kinetic changes in cAMP concentration over a broad dynamic range. To accomplish this, we have evolved a luminescent biosensor for cAMP to better encompass the physiological concentration ranges present in living cells. When compared to an immunoassay, the evolved biosensor construct was able to accurately track both the magnitude and kinetics of cAMP change using a far less labor intensive format. We demonstrate the utility of this construct to detect a broad range of receptor activity, together with showing suitability for use in high-throughput screening.},

We report an improvement in photon yield by over three orders of magnitude over current bioluminescent systems. We imaged cellular movement at high resolution including neuronal growth cones and microglial cell protrusions. Transgenic ffLuc-cp156 mice enabled video-rate bioluminescence imaging of freely moving animals, which may provide a reliable assay for drug distribution in behaving animals for pre-clinical studies.},

abstract = {Cytoplasmic dyneins are motor proteins in the AAA+ superfamily that power transport of cellular cargos towards microtubule minus-ends. Recently, ciliobrevins were reported as selective cell-permeable inhibitors of cytoplasmic dyneins. As is often true for first-in-class inhibitors, the use of ciliobrevins has been limited by low potency. Moreover, suboptimal chemical properties, such as the potential to isomerize, have hindered efforts to improve ciliobrevins. Here, we characterized the structure of ciliobrevins and designed conformationally-constrained isosteres. We identified dynapyrazoles, inhibitors more potent than ciliobrevins in vitro, and find that while ciliobrevins inhibit both dynein's microtubule-stimulated and basal ATPase activity, dynapyrazoles block only microtubule-stimulated activity. Single-digit micromolar concentrations of dynapyrazoles block intraflagellar transport in the cilium and lysosome motility in the cytoplasm, processes that depend on cytoplasmic dyneins. Together, our studies suggest that chemical structure-based analyses can lead to inhibitors with distinct modes of inhibition and improved properties.},

abstract = {Cell-surface glycans are attractive targets for molecule imaging due to their reflection of cellular processes associated with development and disease progression. In this paper, we describe the design, synthesis, and biological application of a new phosphine probe for real-time imaging of cell-surface glycans using bioluminescence. To accomplish this goal, we took advantage of the bioorthogonal chemical reporter technique. This strategy uses a two-step labeling procedure in which an unnatural sugar analogue containing a functional handle is (1) incorporated into sugar-bearing proteins via the cell{\textquoteright}s own biosynthetic machinery and then (2) detected with an exogenously added probe. We designed phosphine{\textminus}luciferin reagent 1 to activate bioluminescence in response to Staudinger ligation with azide-labeled glycans. We chose to use a phosphine probe because, despite their slow reaction kinetics, they remain the best-performing reagents for tagging azidosugars in mice. Given the sensitivity and negligible backg...},

abstract = {According to the domain alternation mechanism and crystal structure evidence, the acyl-CoA synthetases, one of three subgroups of a superfamily of adenylating enzymes, catalyze adenylate- and thioester-forming half-reactions in two different conformations. The enzymes accomplish this by presenting two active sites through an ∼140{\textdegree} rotation of the C-domain. The second half-reaction catalyzed by another subgroup, the beetle luciferases, is a mechanistically dissimilar oxidative process that produces bioluminescence. We have demonstrated that a firefly luciferase variant containing cysteine residues at positions 108 and 447 can be intramolecularly cross-linked by 1,2-bis(maleimido)ethane, trapping the enzyme in a C-domain-rotated conformation previously undocumented in the available luciferase crystal structures. The cross-linked luciferase cannot adenylate luciferin but is nearly fully capable of bioluminescence with synthetic luciferyl adenylate because it retains the ability to carry out the oxidative hal...},

abstract = {The ability to engineer biological circuits that process and respond to complex cellular signals has the potential to impact many areas of biology and medicine. Transcriptional activator-like effectors (TALEs) have emerged as an attractive component for engineering these circuits, as TALEs can be designed de novo to target a given DNA sequence. Currently, however, the use of TALEs is limited by degeneracy in the site-specific manner by which they recognize DNA. Here, we propose an algorithm to computationally address this problem. We apply our algorithm to design 180 TALEs targeting 20 bp cognate binding sites that are at least 3 nt mismatches away from all 20 bp sequences in putative 2 kb human promoter regions. We generated eight of these synthetic TALE activators and showed that each is able to activate transcription from a targeted reporter. Importantly, we show that these proteins do not activate synthetic reporters containing mismatches similar to those present in the genome nor a set of endogenous genes predicted to be the most likely targets in vivo. Finally, we generated and characterized TALE repressors comprised of our orthogonal DNA binding domains and further combined them with shRNAs to accomplish near complete repression of target gene expression.},

abstract = {The suborder Corynebacterineae encompasses species like Corynebacterium glutamicum, which has been harnessed for industrial production of amino acids, as well as Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which cause devastating human diseases. A distinctive component of the Corynebacterineae cell envelope is the mycolyl-arabinogalactan (mAG) complex. The mAG is composed of lipid mycolic acids, and arabinofuranose (Araf) and galactofuranose (Galf) carbohydrate residues. Elucidating microbe-specific differences in mAG composition could advance biotechnological applications and lead to new antimicrobial targets. To this end, we compare and contrast galactan biosynthesis in C. diphtheriae and M. tuberculosis In each species, the galactan is constructed from uridine 5'-diphosphate-$\alpha$-d-galactofuranose (UDP-Galf), which is generated by the enzyme UDP-galactopyranose mutase (UGM or Glf). UGM and the galactan are essential in M. tuberculosis, but their importance in Corynebacterium species was not known. We show that small molecule inhibitors of UGM impede C. glutamicum growth, suggesting that the galactan is critical in corynebacteria. Previous cell wall analysis data suggest the galactan polymer is longer in mycobacterial species than corynebacterial species. To explore the source of galactan length variation, a C. diphtheriae ortholog of the M. tuberculosis carbohydrate polymerase responsible for the bulk of galactan polymerization, GlfT2, was produced, and its catalytic activity was evaluated. The C. diphtheriae GlfT2 gave rise to shorter polysaccharides than those obtained with the M. tuberculosis GlfT2. These data suggest that GlfT2 alone can influence galactan length. Our results provide tools, both small molecule and genetic, for probing and perturbing the assembly of the Corynebacterineae cell envelope.},

abstract = {Surveillance of the extracellular environment by immune receptors is of central importance to eukaryotic survival. The rice receptor kinase XA21, which confers robust resistance to most strains of the Gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae ( Xoo ), is representative of a large class of cell surface immune receptors in plants and animals. We report the identification of a previously undescribed Xoo protein, called RaxX, which is required for activation of XA21-mediated immunity. Xoo strains that lack RaxX, or carry mutations in the single RaxX tyrosine residue (Y41), are able to evade XA21-mediated immunity. Y41 of RaxX is sulfated by the prokaryotic tyrosine sulfotransferase RaxST. Sulfated, but not nonsulfated, RaxX triggers hallmarks of the plant immune response in an XA21-dependent manner. A sulfated, 21{\textendash}amino acid synthetic RaxX peptide (RaxX21-sY) is sufficient for this activity. Xoo field isolates that overcome XA21-mediated immunity encode an alternate raxX allele, suggesting that coevolutionary interactions between host and pathogen contribute to RaxX diversification. RaxX is highly conserved in many plant pathogenic Xanthomonas species. The new insights gained from the discovery and characterization of the sulfated protein, RaxX, can be applied to the development of resistant crop varieties and therapeutic reagents that have the potential to block microbial infection of both plants and animals.},

abstract = { Bioluminescence imaging has evolved as a powerful tool for monitoring biological processesin vivo. As transmission efficiency of light through tissue increases greatly for wavelengths above 600 nm we examined whether a redshifted codon-optimized firefly luciferase ($\lambda$max = 615 nm) could be successfully employed as a sensitive reporter in mammalian cells. To this end, unmodified codon-optimized luciferase ($\lambda$max = 557 nm) as well as the red-emitting S284T mutant luciferase were expressed simultaneously in human glioma cellsin vitro as well as in quadriceps muscles of mice in vivo. We show here that activity of the redshifted enzyme in human glioma cell culture approached approximately one-fourth of that seen with the unmodified enzyme. In contrast, light emission by the red-emitting luciferase in vivo was generally more efficient than that produced by its unmodified counterpart, most likely due to reduced absorption of red light by tissue. The mean ratio of light emission produced by the redshifted luciferase to that of the unmodified enzymein vivo was 3. Application of this new redshifted luciferase together with other optical reporters may be of considerable importance to biological research as it allows for imaging of deeper tissues as well as simultaneous monitoring of two molecular events in vitro and in vivo if appropriate filter sets are employed.},

abstract = {Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) systems to date have been dominated by use of blue-green Renilla luciferase (Rluc) as the energy donor. Although effective in many cases, the expense and unfavorable biochemical attributes of the substrate (phenylcoelenterazine) limit utility of Rluc-based BRET systems. Herein we report a series of novel BRET pairs based on luciferases that utilize D-luciferin, resulting in red-shifted photonic outputs, favorable biochemical attributes, and increased efficacy. We developed a modified F{\"o}rster equation to predict optimal BRET luciferase donor-fluorophore pairs and identified tdTomato as the optimal red fluorophore acceptor for click beetle green luciferase (CBG). A prototypical single-chain protease biosensor, capable of reporting on executioner caspase activity in live cells and in real-time, was generated by inserting a DEVD linker between CBG and tdTomato and validated in vitro with recombinant caspases and in cellulo with apoptosis-sensitive and -resistant cell lines. High signal-to-noise ratios ( approximately 33) and Z' factors (0.85) were observed in live cell longitudinal studies, sufficient for high-throughput screening. Thus, we illustrate a general methodology for the rational design of new BRET systems and provide a novel single-chain BRET protease biosensor that is long lived, red-shifted, and utilizes D-luciferin.},

abstract = {Many human proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions, and disorder in these proteins can be fundamental to their function-for example, facilitating transient but specific binding, promoting allostery, or allowing efficient posttranslational modification. SasG, a multidomain protein implicated in host colonization and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus, provides another example of how disorder can play an important role. Approximately one-half of the domains in the extracellular repetitive region of SasG are intrinsically unfolded in isolation, but these E domains fold in the context of their neighboring folded G5 domains. We have previously shown that the intrinsic disorder of the E domains mediates long-range cooperativity between nonneighboring G5 domains, allowing SasG to form a long, rod-like, mechanically strong structure. Here, we show that the disorder of the E domains coupled with the remarkable stability of the interdomain interface result in cooperative folding kinetics across long distances. Formation of a small structural nucleus at one end of the molecule results in rapid structure formation over a distance of 10 nm, which is likely to be important for the maintenance of the structural integrity of SasG. Moreover, if this normal folding nucleus is disrupted by mutation, the interdomain interface is sufficiently stable to drive the folding of adjacent E and G5 domains along a parallel folding pathway, thus maintaining cooperative folding.},

To increase detection sensitivity and response dynamics, we genetically engineered firefly luciferase to detect specific intermolecular interactions through modulation of its luminescence activity. This concept has been applied in covalent, noncovalent, and allosteric design configurations. The covalent design gives sensitive detection of protease activity through a cleavage-dependent increase in luminescence. The noncovalent and allosteric designs allow reversible detection of the small molecules rapamycin and cAMP, respectively. These sensors allow detection of molecular processes within living cells following addition of the luciferin substrate to the growth medium. For example, the cAMP sensor allows monitoring of intracellular signal transduction associated with G-protein coupled receptor function. These and other...},

Using new algorithms that rely on hashing techniques to construct active sites for multistep reactions, we designed retro-aldolases that use four different catalytic motifs to catalyze the breaking of a carbon-carbon bond in a nonnatural substrate. Of the 72 designs that were experimentally characterized, 32, spanning a range of protein folds, had detectable retro-aldolase activity. Designs that used an explicit water molecule to mediate proton shuffling were significantly more successful, with rate accelerations of up to four orders of magnitude and multiple turnovers, than those involving charged side-chain networks. The atomic accuracy of the design process was confirmed by the x-ray crystal structure of active designs embedded in two protein scaffolds, both of which were nearly superimposable on the design model.},

abstract = {Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with the development of autoantibodies to citrullinated self-proteins. Citrullinated synovial proteins, which are generated via the actions of the protein arginine deiminases (PADs), are known to develop in the murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model of inflammatory arthritis. Given these findings, we evaluated whether N-$\alpha$-benzoyl-N5-(2-chloro-1-iminoethyl)-l-ornithine amide (Cl-amidine), a recently described pan-PAD inhibitor, could affect the development of arthritis and autoimmunity by treating mice in the CIA model with Cl-amidine on days 0{\textendash}35. Cl-amidine treatment reduced total synovial and serum citrullination, decreased clinical disease activity by ∼50%, and significantly decreased IgG2a anti-mouse type II collagen Abs. Additionally, histopathology scores and total complement C3 deposition were significantly lower in Cl-amidine{\textendash}treated mice compared with vehicle controls. Synovial microarray analyses demonstrated decreased IgG reactivity to several native and citrullinated epitopes compared with vehicle controls. Cl-amidine treatment had no ameliorative effect on collagen Ab-induced arthritis, suggesting its primary protective mechanism was not mediated through effector pathways. Reduced levels of citrullinated synovial proteins observed in mice treated with Cl-amidine are consistent with the notion that Cl-amidine derives its efficacy from its ability to inhibit the deiminating activity of PADs. In total, these results suggested that PADs are necessary participants in the autoimmune and subsequent inflammatory processes in CIA. Cl-amidine may represent a novel class of disease-modifying agents that modulate aberrant citrullination, and perhaps other immune processes, necessary for the development of inflammatory arthritis.},

abstract = {Bioluminescent and fluorescent reporters are finding increased use in optical molecular imaging in small animals. In the work presented here, issues related to the sensitivity of in vivo detection are examined for standard reporters. A high-sensitivity imaging system that can detect steady-state emission from both bioluminescent and fluorescent reporters is described. The instrument is absolutely calibrated so that animal images can be analyzed in physical units of radiance allowing more quantitative comparisons to be performed. Background emission from mouse tissue, called autoluminescence and autofluorescence, is measured and found to be an important limitation to detection sensitivity of reporters. Measurements of dual-labeled (bioluminescent/fluorescent) reporter systems, including PC-3M-luc/DsRed2-1 and HeLa-luc/PKH26, are shown. The results indicate that although fluorescent signals are generally brighter than bioluminescent signals, the very low autoluminescent levels usually results in superior signal to background ratios for bioluminescent imaging, particularly compared with fluorescent imaging in the green to red part of the spectrum. Fluorescence detection sensitivity improves in the far-red to near-infrared, provided the animals are fed a low-chlorophyll diet to reduce autofluorescence in the intestinal region. The use of blue-shifted excitation filters is explored as a method to subtract out tissue autofluorescence and improve the sensitivity of fluorescent imaging.},

Their modular structures make them ideal candidates for pooled library screening approaches. Key technologies for library generation and screening, such as SICLOPPS, phage display and mRNA display, give unparalleled access to tight binding peptides. Through combination with genetic code reprogramming and chemical modifications, access to more natural product-like libraries, spanning non-canonical peptide space, is readily achievable. Recent advances in these fields enable introduction of diverse non-standard motifs, such as cyclisation and backbone methylations. Peptide discovery platforms now allow robust access to potent, highly functionalised peptides against virtually any protein of interest, with typical binding constants in the nanomolar range. Application of these optimised platforms in a drug discovery setting has the potential to significantly accelerate identification of new leads.},

New methods and technology have brought great advances in understanding of the molecular basis of bioluminescence, its physiological control, and its significance in marine communities. Novel tools derived from understanding the chemistry of natural light-producing molecules have led to countless valuable applications, culminating recently in a related Nobel Prize. Marine organisms utilize bioluminescence for vital functions ranging from defense to reproduction. To understand these interactions and the distributions of luminous organisms, new instruments and platforms allow observations on individual to oceanographic scales. This review explores recent advances, including the chemical and molecular, phylogenetic and functional, community and oceanographic aspects of bioluminescence.},

Our goal was to obligately fill the adenine-binding pocket on the enzyme molecule, and to thus pre-orient the imidazole side chain of His119 in its catalytically productive orientation. Two designed analogues of the RNase A protein molecule that contained an adenine moiety covalently bound to distinct amino acid side chains adjacent to the adenine binding pocket were prepared. A crystal structure of one analogue was determined at 2.3 {\AA} resolution. Kinetic data for RNA transphosporylation and 2{\textasciiacute},3{\textasciiacute} cyclic mononucleotide hydrolysis were acquired for the adenine-containing RNase A analogue proteins. As anticipated, the presence of a covalently attached adenine on the enzyme molecule decreased the rate of transphosphorylation and increased the rate of hydrolysis, although the magnitude of the effects was small. This work illustrates the use of total protein synthesis to investigate the chemistry of enzyme catalysis in ways not possible through traditional biochemistry or molecular biology.},

abstract = {Firefly luciferase is one of the few soluble proteins that is acted upon by a wide variety of general anesthetics and alcohols; they inhibit the ATP-driven production of light. We have used time-resolved photolabeling to locate the binding sites of alcohols during the initial light output, some 200 ms after adding ATP. The photolabel 3-azioctanol inhibited the initial light output with an IC50 of 200 {\textmu}M, close to its general anesthetic potency. Photoincorporation of [(3)H]3-azioctanol into luciferase was saturable but weak. It was enhanced 200 ms after adding ATP but was negligible minutes later. Sequencing of tryptic digests by HPLC-MSMS revealed a similar conformation-dependence for photoincorporation of 3-azioctanol into Glu-313, a residue that lines the bottom of a deep cleft (vestibule) whose outer end binds luciferin. An aromatic diazirine analog of benzyl alcohol with broader side chain reactivity reported two sites. First, it photolabeled two residues in the vestibule, Ser-286 and Ile-288, both of which are implicated with Glu-313 in the conformation change accompanying activation. Second, it photolabeled two residues that contact luciferin, Ser-316 and Ser-349. Thus, time resolved photolabeling supports two mechanisms of action. First, an allosteric one, in which anesthetics bind in the vestibule displacing water molecules that are thought to be involved in light output. Second, a competitive one, in which anesthetics bind isosterically with luciferin. This work provides structural evidence that supports the competitive and allosteric actions previously characterized by kinetic studies.},

Luciferase is derived from the firefly (Photinus pyralis) and is synthesized and stored in the cells of the firefly's lantern organ, where it is also found in peroxisomes. The fact that this protein is similarly targeted in cells from such different organisms suggests that the process of protein transport to peroxisomes has been highly conserved through evolution.},

abstract = {The continual public health threat posed by the emergence of novel influenza viruses necessitates the ability to rapidly monitor infection and spread in experimental systems. To analyze real-time infection dynamics, we have created a replication-competent influenza reporter virus suitable for in vivo imaging. The reporter virus encodes the small and bright NanoLuc luciferase whose activity serves as an extremely sensitive readout of viral infection. This virus stably maintains the reporter construct and replicates in culture and in mice with near-native properties. Bioluminescent imaging of the reporter virus permits serial observations of viral load and dissemination in infected animals, even following clearance of a sublethal challenge. We further show that the reporter virus recapitulates known restrictions due to host range and antiviral treatment, suggesting that this technology can be applied to studying emerging influenza viruses and the impact of antiviral interventions on infections in vivo. These results describe a generalizable method to quickly determine the replication and pathogenicity potential of diverse influenza strains in animals.},

abstract = {Human pancreatic $\alpha$-amylase (HPA) is responsible~for degrading starch to malto-oligosaccharides, thence to glucose, and is therefore an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes and obesity. Here we report the discovery of a unique lariat nonapeptide, by means of the RaPID (Random non-standard Peptides Integrated Discovery) system, composed of five amino acids in a head-to-side-chain thioether macrocycle and a further four amino acids in a 310 helical C terminus. This is a potent inhibitor of HPA (Ki~= 7~nM) yet exhibits selectivity for the target over other glycosidases tested. Structural studies show that this nonapeptide forms a compact tertiary structure, and illustrate that a general inhibitory motif involving two phenolic groups is often accessed for tight binding of inhibitors to HPA. Furthermore, the work reported here demonstrates the potential of this methodology for the discovery of de novo peptide inhibitors against other glycosidases.},

abstract = {PAR-2 belongs to a family of G-protein coupled Protease-Activated Receptors (PAR) which are activated by specific proteolytic cleavage in the extracellular N-terminal region. PAR-2 is activated by proteases such as trypsin, tryptase, proteinase 3, factor VIIa, factor Xa and is thought to be a mediator of inflammation and tissue injury, where elevated levels of proteases are found. Utilizing the HuCAL GOLD{\textregistered} phage display library we generated fully human antibodies specifically blocking the protease cleavage site in the N-terminal domain. In vitro affinity optimization resulted in antibodies with up to 1000-fold improved affinities relative to the original parental antibodies with dissociation constants as low as 100 pM. Corresponding increases in potency were observed in a mechanistic protease cleavage assay. The antibodies effectively inhibited PAR-2 mediated intracellular calcium release and cytokine secretion in various cell types stimulated with trypsin. In addition, the antibodies demonstrated potent inhibition of trypsin induced relaxation of isolated rat aortic rings ex vivo. In a short term mouse model of inflammation, the trans vivo DTH model, anti-PAR-2 antibodies showed inhibition of the inflammatory swelling response. In summary, potent inhibitors of PAR-2 were generated which allow further assessment of the role of this receptor in inflammation and evaluation of their potential as therapeutic agents.},

abstract = { Radical ions of organic dyes are highly reactive species and have been studied for decades by transient absorption spectroscopy and pulse radiolysis experiments in oxygen-depleted solution. Here we show by continuous wave EPR, absorption, and fluorescence experiments that the triplet state of rhodamine dyes can be photoreduced by thiols to form stable radical anions in aqueous solution with a lifetime of up to several hours. Our data demonstrate that reduction of the triplet state and photoinduced oxidation of reactive intermediates by oxygen represents a general mechanism for reversible photoswitching of dyes in aqueous thiol-containing solutions highlighting the key role of molecular oxygen for super-resolution fluorescence imaging. Since cells contain the thiol glutathione at millimolar concentrations and reactive oxygen species are formed as side products our findings are of consequence for live cell fluorescence microscopy.},

abstract = {Light-oxygen-voltage sensitive (LOV) flavoproteins are ubiquitous photoreceptors that mediate responses to environmental cues. Photosensory inputs are transduced into signaling outputs via structural rearrangements in sensor domains that consequently modulate the activity of an effector domain or multidomain clusters. Establishing the diversity in effector function and sensor-effector topology will inform what signaling mechanisms govern light-responsive behaviors across multiple kingdoms of life and how these signals are transduced. Here, we report the bioinformatics identification of over 6,700 candidate LOV domains (including over 4,000 previously unidentified sequences from plants and protists), and insights from their annotations for ontological function and structural arrangements. Motif analysis identified the sensors from ∼42 million ORFs, with strong statistical separation from other flavoproteins and non-LOV members of the structurally related Per-aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)-Sim family. Conserved-domain analysis determined putative light-regulated function and multidomain topologies. We found that for certain effectors, sensor-effector linker length is discretized based on both phylogeny and the preservation of $\alpha$-helical heptad repeats within an extended coiled-coil linker structure. This finding suggests that preserving sensor-effector orientation is a key determinant of linker length, in addition to ancestry, in LOV signaling structure-function. We found a surprisingly high prevalence of effectors with functions previously thought to be rare among LOV proteins, such as regulators of G protein signaling, and discovered several previously unidentified effectors, such as lipases. This work highlights the value of applying genomic and transcriptomic technologies to diverse organisms to capture the structural and functional variation in photosensory proteins that are vastly important in adaptation, photobiology, and optogenetics.},

A new cell surface-engineering strategy is described that uses lipid-chemically self-assembled nanorings (lipid-CSANs) that can be used for the stable and reversible modification of any cell surface with a molecular reporter or targeting ligand. In the presence of a non-toxic FDA-approved drug, the nanorings were quickly disassembled and the cell-cell interactions reversed. Similar to T-cells genetically engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARS), when activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were functionalized with the anti-EpCAM-lipid-CSANs, they were shown to selectively kill antigen-positive cancer cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that lipid-CSANs have the potential to be a rapid, stable, and general method for the reversible engineering of cell surfaces and cell-cell interactions.},

Nevertheless, luminescence has maintained a prominent position among certain assay formats, most notably genetic reporters. Recently, there has been growing partiality for luminescent assays across a wider range of applications due to their sensitivity, broad linearity, and robustness to library compounds and complex biological samples. This trend has been fostered by the development of several new assay designs for diverse targets such as kinases, cytochrome p450s, proteases, apoptosis, and cytotoxicity. This review addresses recent progress made in the use of bioluminescent assays for HTS, highlighting new detection capabilities brought about by engineering luciferase genes, enzymes, and substrates. In genetic reporter applications, modifications to the luciferase genes have improved assay sensitivity by substantially increasing expr...},

abstract = {Surveillance of the extracellular environment by immune receptors is of central importance to eukaryotic survival. The rice receptor kinase XA21, which confers robust resistance to most strains of the Gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae ( Xoo ), is representative of a large class of cell surface immune receptors in plants and animals. We report the identification of a previously undescribed Xoo protein, called RaxX, which is required for activation of XA21-mediated immunity. Xoo strains that lack RaxX, or carry mutations in the single RaxX tyrosine residue (Y41), are able to evade XA21-mediated immunity. Y41 of RaxX is sulfated by the prokaryotic tyrosine sulfotransferase RaxST. Sulfated, but not nonsulfated, RaxX triggers hallmarks of the plant immune response in an XA21-dependent manner. A sulfated, 21{\textendash}amino acid synthetic RaxX peptide (RaxX21-sY) is sufficient for this activity. Xoo field isolates that overcome XA21-mediated immunity encode an alternate raxX allele, suggesting that coevolutionary interactions between host and pathogen contribute to RaxX diversification. RaxX is highly conserved in many plant pathogenic Xanthomonas species. The new insights gained from the discovery and characterization of the sulfated protein, RaxX, can be applied to the development of resistant crop varieties and therapeutic reagents that have the potential to block microbial infection of both plants and animals.},

Low light bioluminescence microscopy was employed to localize p21 expression to specific regions of the brain. Interestingly, p21 expression was observed in the paraventricular, arcuate, and dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus, regions that detect nutrient levels in the blood stream and signal metabolic actions throughout the body. These results suggested a link between p21 expression and metabolic regulation. We found that short-term food deprivation (fasting) potently induced p21 expression in tissues involved in metabolic regulation including liver, pancreas and hypothalamic nuclei. Conditional reporter mice were generated that enabled hepatocyte-specific expression of p21 to be monitored in vivo. Bioluminescence imaging demonstrated that fasting induced a 7-fold increase in p21 expression in livers of reporter mice and Western blotting demonstrated an increase in protein levels as well. The ability of fasting to induce p21 expression was found to be independent of p53 but dependent on FOXO1. Finally, occupancy of the endogenous p21 promoter by FOXO1 was observed in the livers of fasted but not fed mice. Thus, fasting promotes loading of FOXO1 onto the p21 promoter to induce p21 expression in hepatocytes.},

abstract = {Information transmission in biological signaling networks is commonly considered to be a unidirectional flow of information between protein partners. According to this view, many bacterial response regulator proteins utilize input receiver (REC) domains to "switch" functional outputs, using REC phosphorylation to shift pre-existing equilibria between inactive and active conformations. However, recent data indicate that output domains themselves also shift such equilibria, implying a "mutual inhibition" model. Here we use solution nuclear magnetic resonance to provide a mechanistic basis for such control in a PhyR-type response regulator. Our structure of~the isolated, non-phosphorylated REC domain surprisingly reveals a fully active conformation, letting us identify structural and dynamic changes imparted by the output domain to inactivate the full-length protein. Additional data reveal transient structural changes within the full-length protein, facilitating activation. Our data provide a basis for understanding the changes that REC and output domains undergo to set a default "inactive" state.},

abstract = {Interactions among neighboring cells underpin many physiological processes ranging from early development to immune responses. When these interactions do not function properly, numerous pathologies, including infection and cancer, can result. Molecular imaging technologies, especially optical imaging, are uniquely suited to illuminate complex cellular interactions within the context of living tissues in the body. However, no tools yet exist that allow the detection of microscopic events, such as two cells coming into close proximity, on a global, whole-animal scale. We report here a broadly applicable, longitudinal strategy for probing interactions among cells in living subjects. This approach relies on the generation of bioluminescent light when two distinct cell populations come into close proximity, with the intensity of the optical signal correlating with relative cellular location. We demonstrate the ability of this reporter strategy to gauge cell-cell proximity in culture models in vitro and then evaluate this approach for imaging tumor-immune cell interactions using a murine breast cancer model. In these studies, our imaging strategy enabled the facile visualization of features that are otherwise difficult to observe with conventional imaging techniques, including detection of micrometastatic lesions and potential sites of tumor immunosurveillance. This proximity reporter will facilitate probing of numerous types of cell-cell interactions and will stimulate the development of similar techniques to detect rare events and pathological processes in live animals.},

abstract = {Electron deficient, bivalent sulfur atoms have two areas of positive electrostatic potential, a consequence of the low-lying $\sigma$* orbitals of the C-S bond that are available for interaction with electron donors including oxygen and nitrogen atoms and, possibly, $\pi$-systems. Intramolecular interactions are by far the most common manifestation of this effect, which offers a means of modulating the conformational preferences of a molecule. Although a well-documented phenomenon, a priori applications in drug design are relatively sparse and this interaction, which is often isosteric with an intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction, appears to be underappreciated by the medicinal chemistry community. In this Perspective, we discuss the theoretical basis for sulfur $\sigma$* orbital interactions and illustrate their importance in the context of drug design and organic synthesis. The role of sulfur interactions in protein structure and function is discussed and although relatively rare, intermolecular interactions between ligand C-S $\sigma$* orbitals and proteins are illustrated.},

abstract = {The present paper describes the total chemical synthesis of the precursor molecule of the Aequorea green fluorescent protein (GFP). The molecule is made up of 238 amino acid residues in a single polypeptide chain and is nonfluorescent. To carry out the synthesis, a procedure, first described in 1981 for the synthesis of complex peptides, was used. The procedure is based on performing segment condensation reactions in solution while providing maximum protection to the segment. The effectiveness of the procedure has been demonstrated by the synthesis of various biologically active peptides and small proteins, such as human angiogenin, a 123-residue protein analogue of ribonuclease A, human midkine, a 121-residue protein, and pleiotrophin, a 136-residue protein analogue of midkine. The GFP precursor molecule was synthesized from 26 fully protected segments in solution, and the final 238-residue peptide was treated with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride to obtain the precursor molecule of GFP containing two Cys(acetamidomethyl) residues. After removal of the acetamidomethyl groups, the product was dissolved in 0.1 M Tris. HCl buffer (pH 8.0) in the presence of DTT. After several hours at room temperature, the solution began to emit a green fluorescence (lambdamax = 509 nm) under near-UV light. Both fluorescence excitation and fluorescence emission spectra were measured and were found to have the same shape and maxima as those reported for native GFP. The present results demonstrate the utility of the segment condensation procedure in synthesizing large protein molecules such as GFP. The result also provides evidence that the formation of the chromophore in GFP is not dependent on any external cofactor.},

An ex vivo assay based on human whole blood that is more sensitive and relevant than traditional cell-line based assays for predicting in vivo circulation behavior is introduced. The association of MS@PEG particles (template present) with granulocytes and monocytes is higher compared with PEG particles (template absent). Increasing the PEG molecular weight (from 10 to 40 kDa) or decreasing the PEG particle size (from 1400 to 150 nm) reduces phagocytic blood cell association of the PEG particles. Mice biodistribution studies show that the PEG particles exhibit extended circulation times (>12 h) compared with the MS@PEG particles and that the retention of smaller PEG particles (150 nm) in blood, when compared with ...},

abstract = {Despite their versatility and power in controlling gene regulation in nature, nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) have largely eluded utility in heterologous gene regulation applications such as gene therapy and metabolic engineering. The main reason for this void is the pleiotropic interference of the receptor-ligand combination with regulatory networks in the host organism. In recent years, numerous strategies have been developed to engineer ligand-receptor pairs that do not cross-interact with host regulatory pathways. However, these strategies have either met with limited success or cannot be readily extended to other ligand-receptor pairs. Here, we present a simple, effective, and readily generalizable strategy for reengineering NHRs to respond specifically to a selected synthetic ligand. The method involves generation of genetic diversity by stepwise individual site saturation mutagenesis of a fixed set of ligand-contacting residues and random point mutagenesis, followed by phenotypic screening based on a yeast two-hybrid system. As a test case, this method was used to alter the specificity of the NHR human estrogen receptor alpha in favor of the synthetic ligand 4,4'-dihydroxybenzil, relative to the natural ligand 17beta-estradiol, by >10(7)-fold. The resulting ligand-receptor pair is highly sensitive to the synthetic ligand in human endometrial cancer cells and is essentially fully orthogonal to the wild-type receptor-natural ligand pair. This method should provide a powerful, broadly applicable tool for engineering receptors/enzymes with improved or novel ligand/substrate specificity.},

abstract = {Chemically self-assembled nanorings (CSANs) are made of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) fusion proteins and have been successfully used in vitro for cellular cargo delivery and cell surface engineering applications. However, CSANs have yet to be evaluated for their in vivo stability, circulation, and tissue distribution. In an effort to evaluate CSANs in vivo, we engineered a site-specifically PEGylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting DHFR molecules, characterized their self-assembly into CSANs with bivalent methotrexates (bis-MTX), visualized their in vivo tissue localization by microPET/CT imaging, and determined their ex vivo organ biodistribution by tissue-based gamma counting. A dimeric DHFR (DHFR(2)) molecule fused with a C-terminal EGFR targeting peptide (LARLLT) was engineered to incorporate a site-specific ketone functionality using unnatural amino acid mutagenesis. Aminooxy-PEG, of differing chain lengths, was successfully conjugated to the protein using oxime chemistry. These proteins were self-assembled into CSANs with bis-MTX DHFR dimerizers and characterized by size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering. In vitro binding studies were performed with fluorescent CSANs assembled using bis-MTX-FITC, while in vivo microPET/CT imaging was performed with radiolabeled CSANs assembled using bis-MTX-DOTA[(64)Cu]. PEGylation reduced the uptake of anti-EGFR CSANs by mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7) up to 40% without altering the CSAN's binding affinity toward U-87 MG glioblastoma cells in vitro. A significant time dependent tumor accumulation of (64)Cu labeled anti-EGFR-CSANs was observed by microPET/CT imaging and biodistribution studies in mice bearing U-87 MG xenografts. PEGylated CSANs demonstrated a reduced uptake by the liver, kidneys, and spleen resulting in high contrast tumor imaging within an hour of intravenous injection (9.6% ID/g), and continued to increase up to 24 h (11.7% ID/g) while the background signal diminished. CSANs displayed an in vivo profile between those of rapidly clearing small molecules and slow clearing antibodies. Thus, CSANs offer a modular, programmable, and stable protein based platform that can be used for in vivo drug delivery and imaging applications.},

abstract = {Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) systems to date have been dominated by use of blue-green Renilla luciferase (Rluc) as the energy donor. Although effective in many cases, the expense and unfavorable biochemical attributes of the substrate (phenylcoelenterazine) limit utility of Rluc-based BRET systems. Herein we report a series of novel BRET pairs based on luciferases that utilize D-luciferin, resulting in red-shifted photonic outputs, favorable biochemical attributes, and increased efficacy. We developed a modified F{\"o}rster equation to predict optimal BRET luciferase donor-fluorophore pairs and identified tdTomato as the optimal red fluorophore acceptor for click beetle green luciferase (CBG). A prototypical single-chain protease biosensor, capable of reporting on executioner caspase activity in live cells and in real-time, was generated by inserting a DEVD linker between CBG and tdTomato and validated in vitro with recombinant caspases and in cellulo with apoptosis-sensitive and -resistant cell lines. High signal-to-noise ratios ( approximately 33) and Z' factors (0.85) were observed in live cell longitudinal studies, sufficient for high-throughput screening. Thus, we illustrate a general methodology for the rational design of new BRET systems and provide a novel single-chain BRET protease biosensor that is long lived, red-shifted, and utilizes D-luciferin.},

In order to make these and other thioamide experiments applicable to full-sized proteins, we have developed methods for incorporating thioamides by generating thiopeptide fragments through solid phase synthesis and ligating them to protein fragments expressed in E. coli. To install donor fluorophores, we have adapted unnatural amino acid mutagenesis methods, including the generation of new tRNA synthetases for the incorporation of small, intrinsically fluorescent amino acids. We have used a combination of these two methods, as well as chemoenzymatic protein modification, to efficiently install sidechain and backbone modifications to generate proteins labeled with fluorophore/thioamide pairs.},

We demonstrate this approach by recombining the genes coding for TEM1 beta-lactamase (BLA) and the Escherichia coli maltose binding protein (MBP) to create a family of MBP-BLA hybrids in which maltose is a positive or negative effector of beta-lactam hydrolysis. Some of these MBP-BLA switches were effectively "on-off" in nature, with maltose altering catalytic activity by as much as 600-fold. The ability of these switches to confer an effector-dependent growth/no growth phenotype to E. coli cells was exploited to rapidly identify, from a library of 4 x 10(6) variants, MBP-BLA switch variants that respond to sucrose as the effector. The transplantation of these mutations into wild-type MBP converted MBP into a "sucrose-binding protein," illustrating the switches potential as a tool to rapidly identify ligand-binding proteins.},

Using the prototypical dye tetramethylsulforhodamine, TMSR, as a benchmark, we show this new dye has higher fluorescent quantum yields, $\Phi$, ($\Phi$ = 0.95 vs $\Phi$ = 0.65 at 20 {\textdegree}C), emission efficiencies that are invariant in the 20{\textrightarrow} 60 {\textdegree}C temperature range ($\Phi$ = 0.95 vs $\Phi$ = 0.38 at 60 {\textdegree}C), and fluorescence lifetimes that increase with a rise in temperature (20 {\textrightarrow} 60 {\textdegree}C) as compared to a decrease for the benchmark dye (3.8 {\textrightarrow} 3.9 vs 2.8 {\textrightarrow} 1.7 ns). Importantly, photostability studies found the azabicyclic rhodamine to be many times more stable than its tetramethyl analogue. To the best our knowledge this is the first report of the use of an apex-N-substituted azabicycloalkane as an electron donor group in any class of donor{\textminus}acceptor dye.

A further benefit is that conformational heterogeneity can be harnessed for the discovery of allosteric drug-like modulators, targeting critical pathways in protein homeostasis and transcription.},

The SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) procedure and fluorescence screening in E. coli have been applied to discover the aptamer that can specifically activate the fluorogen with micromolar binding affinity. The systematic mutation and truncation study on the aptamer structure determined the minimum binding domain of the aptamer. A series of rationally modified fluorogen analogues have been made to probe the interacting groups of fluorogen with the aptamer. These results led to the design of a much improved fluorogen ASR 7 that displayed a 33-fold increase in the binding affinity for the selected aptamer in comparison to the original ASR 1 and an 88-fold increase in the fluorescence emission after the aptamer binding. This study demonstrates the value of combining in vitro SELEX and E. coli fl...},

Contrary to this view, molten globule proteins can adopt native topology and bind targets tightly and specifically in the absence of side chain close-packing. The molten globule is a highly dynamic form with native-like secondary structure and a loose protein core that admits solvent. The related (but still controversial) dry molten globule is an expanded form of the native protein with largely intact topology but a tighter protein core that excludes solvent. Neither form retains side chain close-packing, and therefore both structure and function must result from other factors, assuming that the reality of the dry molten globule is accepted. This simplifying realization calls for a re-evaluation of established models.},

abstract = {The molecular structure of the pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl peptidase from Scytalidium lignicolum, formerly known as scytalidopepsin B, was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement phasing methods and refined to an R factor of 0.230 (R(free) = 0.246) at 2.1-A resolution. In addition to the structure of the unbound peptidase, the structure of a product complex of cleaved angiotensin II bound in the active site of the enzyme was also determined. We propose the name scytalidocarboxyl peptidase B (SCP-B) for this enzyme. On the basis of conserved, catalytic residues identified at the active site, we suggest the name Eqolisin for the enzyme family. The previously uninvestigated SCP-B fold is that of a beta-sandwich; each sheet has seven antiparallel strands. A tripeptide product, Ala-Ile-His, bound in the active site of SCP-B has allowed for identification of the catalytic residues and the residues in subsites S1, S2, and S3, which are important for substrate binding. The most likely hydrolytic mechanism involves nucleophilic attack of a general base (Glu-136)-activated water (OH(-)) on the si-face of the scissile peptide carbonylcarbon atom to form a tetrahedral intermediate. Electrophilic assistance and oxyanion stabilization is provided by the side-chain amide of Gln-53. Protonation of the leaving-group nitrogen is accomplished by the general acid function of the protonated carboxyl group of Glu-136.},

An understanding of how threonine phosphorylation regulates biological function will be accelerated by general methods to biosynthesize defined phosphoproteins. Here we describe a rapid approach for directly discovering aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNA pairs that selectively incorporate non-natural amino acids into proteins; our method uses parallel positive selections combined with deep sequencing and statistical analysis and enables the direct, scalable discovery of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNA pairs with mutually orthogonal substrate specificity. By combining a method to biosynthesize phosphothreonine in cells with this selection approach, we discover a phosphothreonyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNACUA pair and create an entirely biosynthetic route to incorporating phosphothreonine in proteins. We biosynthesize several phosphoproteins and demonstrate phosphoprotein structure determination and synthetic protein kinase activation.},

abstract = {Computer simulations of the evolution of linear sequences have demonstrated the importance of recombination of blocks of sequence rather than point mutagenesis alone. Repeated cycles of point mutagenesis, recombination, and selection should allow in vitro molecular evolution of complex sequences, such as proteins. A method for the reassembly of genes from their random DNA fragments, resulting in in vitro recombination is reported. A 1-kb gene, after DNase I digestion and purification of 10- to 50-bp random fragments, was reassembled to its original size and function. Similarly, a 2.7-kb plasmid could be efficiently reassembled. Complete recombination was obtained between two markers separated by 75 bp; each marker was located on a separate gene. Oligonucleotides with 3' and 5' ends that are homologous to the gene can be added to the fragment mixture and incorporated into the reassembled gene. Thus, mixtures of synthetic oligonucleotides and PCR fragments can be mixed into a gene at defined positions based on homology. As an example, a library of chimeras of the human and murine genes for interleukin 1 beta has been prepared. Shuffling can also be used for the in vitro equivalent of some standard genetic manipulations, such as a backcross with parental DNA. The advantages of recombination over existing mutagenesis methods are likely to increase with the numbers of cycles of molecular evolution.},

abstract = {The accumulation of unfolded proteins under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leads to the activation of the multidomain protein sensor IRE1$\alpha$ as part of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Clustering of IRE1$\alpha$ lumenal domains in the presence of unfolded proteins promotes kinase trans-autophosphorylation in the cytosol and subsequent RNase domain activation. Interestingly, there is an allosteric relationship between the kinase and RNase domains of IRE1$\alpha$, which allows ATP-competitive inhibitors to modulate the activity of the RNase domain. Here, we use kinase inhibitors to study how ATP-binding site conformation affects the activity of the RNase domain of IRE1$\alpha$. We find that diverse ATP-competitive inhibitors of IRE1$\alpha$ promote dimerization and activation of RNase activity despite blocking kinase autophosphorylation. In contrast, a subset of ATP-competitive ligands, which we call KIRAs, allosterically inactivate the RNase domain through the kinase domain by stabilizing monomeric IRE1$\alpha$. Further insight into how ATP-competitive inhibitors are able to divergently modulate the RNase domain through the kinase domain was gained by obtaining the first structure of apo human IRE1$\alpha$ in the RNase active back-to-back dimer conformation. Comparison of this structure with other existing structures of IRE1$\alpha$ and integration of our extensive structure activity relationship (SAR) data has led us to formulate a model to rationalize how ATP-binding site ligands are able to control the IRE1$\alpha$ oligomeric state and subsequent RNase domain activity.},

abstract = {According to the domain alternation mechanism and crystal structure evidence, the acyl-CoA synthetases, one of three subgroups of a superfamily of adenylating enzymes, catalyze adenylate- and thioester-forming half-reactions in two different conformations. The enzymes accomplish this by presenting two active sites through an ∼140{\textdegree} rotation of the C-domain. The second half-reaction catalyzed by another subgroup, the beetle luciferases, is a mechanistically dissimilar oxidative process that produces bioluminescence. We have demonstrated that a firefly luciferase variant containing cysteine residues at positions 108 and 447 can be intramolecularly cross-linked by 1,2-bis(maleimido)ethane, trapping the enzyme in a C-domain-rotated conformation previously undocumented in the available luciferase crystal structures. The cross-linked luciferase cannot adenylate luciferin but is nearly fully capable of bioluminescence with synthetic luciferyl adenylate because it retains the ability to carry out the oxidative hal...},

The esters themselves were not substrates for purified luciferase, but four were substrates for a purified esterase and all appeared to be hydrolysed to luciferin within mammalian cells. At a substrate concentration of 0.01 mM, the peak luminescence from the cos cells expressing luciferase was up to 6-fold greater with the esters than with unmodified luciferin. At 0.1 mM, the difference between luciferin and the esters was decreased. The kinetics of the luminescent signal with the different luciferin esters varied significantly, indicating possible differences in the rates of uptake, breakdown and enzyme inhibition. The esters did not support luminescence from Escherichia coli cells expressing firefly luciferase, suggesting a lack of appropriate esterase activity in this particular strain. The esters could be useful for the assay of luciferase expression in intact mammalian cells when luciferin levels are limiting, for example in tissues, and in plants. Alternative luciferin derivatives may allow further improvements in sensitivity.},

Previously, our group showed that thioamides can be incorporated into proteins by native chemical ligation (NCL) with Cys as a ligation handle. In this study, we report the expansion of this strategy into non-Cys ligation sites, utilizing radical initiated desulfurization to {\textquotedblleft}erase{\textquotedblright} the side chain thiol after ligation. The reaction exhibited high chemoselectivity against thioamides, which can be further enhanced with thioacetamide as a sacrificial scavenger. As a proof-of-concept example, we demonstrated the incorporation of a thioamide probe into a 56 amino acid protein, the B1 domain of Protein G (GB1). Finally, we showed that the method can be extended to $\beta$-thiol amino acid analogs and selenocysteine.},

abstract = {Hsp70 proteins are key to maintaining intracellular protein homeostasis. To carry out this task, they employ a large number of cochaperones and adapter proteins. Here, we review what is known about the interaction between the chaperones and partners, with a strong slant toward structural biology. Hsp70s in general, and Hsc70 (HSPA8) in particular, display an amazing array of interfaces with their protein cofactors. We also review the known interactions between Hsp70s with lipids and with active compounds that may become leads toward Hsp70 modulation for treatment of a variety of diseases.},

abstract = {In the past few years there has been a veritable explosion in the field of reporter gene imaging, with the aim of determining the location, duration and extent of gene expression within living subjects. An important application of this approach is the molecular imaging of interacting protein partners, which could pave the way to functional proteomics in living animals and might provide a tool for the whole-body evaluation of new pharmaceuticals targeted to modulate protein-protein interactions. Three general methods are currently available for imaging protein-protein interactions in living subjects using reporter genes: a modified mammalian two-hybrid system, a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) system, and split reporter protein complementation and reconstitution strategies. In the future, these innovative approaches are likely to enhance our appreciation of entire biological pathway systems and their pharmacological regulation.},

abstract = {To examine the role of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) in metastasis, we generated human-in-mouse breast cancer orthotopic models using patient tumor specimens, labeled with optical reporter fusion genes. These models recapitulate human cancer features not captured with previous models, including spontaneous metastasis in particular, and provide a useful platform for studies of breast tumor initiation and progression. With noninvasive imaging approaches, as few as 10 cells of stably labeled BCSCs could be tracked in vivo, enabling studies of early tumor growth and spontaneous metastasis. These advances in BCSC imaging revealed that CD44(+) cells from both primary tumors and lung metastases are highly enriched for tumor-initiating cells. Our metastatic cancer models, combined with noninvasive imaging techniques, constitute an integrated approach that could be applied to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the dissemination of metastatic CSCs (MCSCs) and to explore therapeutic strategies targeting MCSCs in general or to evaluate individual patient tumor cells and predict response to therapy.},

abstract = {The biosynthesis of the luciferin coelenterazine has remained a mystery for decades. While not all organisms that use coelenterazine appear to make it themselves, it is thought that ctenophores are a likely producer. Here we analyze the transcriptome data of 24 species of ctenophores, two of which have published genomes. The natural precursors of coelenterazine have been shown to be the amino acids L-tyrosine and L-phenylalanine, with the most likely biosynthetic pathway involving cyclization and further modification of the tripeptide Phe-Tyr-Tyr ({\textquotedblleft}FYY{\textquotedblright}). Therefore, we searched the ctenophore transcriptome data for genes with the short peptide {\textquotedblleft}FYY{\textquotedblright} as part of their coding sequence. We recovered a group of candidate genes for coelenterazine biosynthesis in the luminous species which encode a set of highly conserved non-heme iron oxidases similar to isopenicillin-N-synthase. These genes were absent in the transcriptomes and genome of the two non-luminous species. Pairwise identities and substitution rates reveal an unusually high degree of identity even between the most unrelated species. Additionally, two related groups of non-heme iron oxidases were found across all ctenophores, including those which are non-luminous, arguing against the involvement of these two gene groups in luminescence. Important residues for iron-binding are conserved across all proteins in the three groups, suggesting this function is still present. Given the known functions of other members of this protein superfamily are involved in heterocycle formation, we consider these genes to be top candidates for laboratory characterization or gene knockouts in the investigation of coelenterazine biosynthesis.},

abstract = {Fluorescent proteins are widely used to study molecular and cellular events, yet this traditionally relies on delivery of excitation light, which can trigger autofluorescence, photoxicity, and photobleaching, impairing their use in vivo . Accordingly, chemiluminescent light sources such as those generated by luciferases have emerged, as they do not require excitation light. However, current luciferase reporters lack the brightness needed to visualize events in deep tissues. We report the creation of chimeric eGFP-NanoLuc (GpNLuc) and LSSmOrange-NanoLuc (OgNLuc) fusion reporter proteins coined LumiFluors, which combine the benefits of eGFP or LSSmOrange fluorescent proteins with the bright, glow-type bioluminescent light generated by an enhanced small luciferase subunit (NanoLuc) of the deep-sea shrimp Oplophorus gracilirostris . The intramolecular bioluminescence resonance energy transfer that occurs between NanoLuc and the fused fluorophore generates the brightest bioluminescent signal known to date, including improved intensity, sensitivity, and durable spectral properties, thereby dramatically reducing image acquisition times and permitting highly sensitive in vivo imaging. Notably, the self-illuminating and bifunctional nature of these LumiFluor reporters enables greatly improved spatiotemporal monitoring of very small numbers of tumor cells via in vivo optical imaging and also allows the isolation and analyses of single cells by flow cytometry. Thus, LumiFluor reporters are inexpensive, robust, noninvasive tools that allow for markedly improved in vivo optical imaging of tumorigenic processes.

abstract = {Members of the genus Mycobacterium cause devastating human diseases, including tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can resist some antibiotics because of its durable and impermeable cell envelope. This barrier is assembled from saccharide building blocks not found in mammals, including galactofuranose (Galf). Within the cell envelope, Galf residues are linked together to afford an essential polysaccharide, termed the galactan. The formation of this polymer is catalyzed by the glycosyltransferase GlfT2, a processive carbohydrate polymerase, which generates a sequence-specific polysaccharide with alternating regioisomeric $\beta$(1-5) and $\beta$(1-6) Galf linkages. GlfT2 exhibits high fidelity in linkage formation, as it will terminate polymerization rather than deviate from its linkage pattern. These findings suggest that GlfT2 would prefer an acceptor with a canonical alternating $\beta$(1-5) and $\beta$(1-6) Galf sequence. To test this hypothesis, we devised a synthetic route to assemble oligosaccharides with natural and non-natural sequences. GlfT2 could elongate each of these acceptors, even those with non-natural linkage patterns. These data indicate that the glycosyltransferase is surprisingly promiscuous in its substrate preferences. However, GlfT2 did favor some substrates: it preferentially acted on those in which the lipid-bearing Galf residue was connected to the sequence by a $\beta$(1-6) glycosidic linkage. The finding that the relative positioning of the lipid and the non-reducing end of the acceptor influences substrate selectivity is consistent with a role for the lipid in acceptor binding. The data also suggest that the fidelity of GlfT2 for generating an alternating $\beta$(1-5) and $\beta$(1-6) pattern of Galf residues arises not from preferential substrate binding but during processive elongation. These observations suggest that inhibiting the action of GlfT2 will afford changes in cell wall structure.},

abstract = {Bioluminescent fungi are spread throughout the globe, but details on their mechanism of light emission are still scarce. Usually, the process involves three key components: an oxidizable luciferin substrate, a luciferase enzyme, and a light emitter, typically oxidized luciferin, and called oxyluciferin. We report the structure of fungal oxyluciferin, investigate the mechanism of fungal bioluminescence, and describe the use of simple synthetic $\alpha$-pyrones as luciferins to produce multicolor enzymatic chemiluminescence. A high-energy endoperoxide is proposed as an intermediate of the oxidation of the native luciferin to the oxyluciferin, which is a pyruvic acid adduct of caffeic acid. Luciferase promiscuity allows the use of simple $\alpha$-pyrones as chemiluminescent substrates.},

abstract = {Firefly luciferase catalyzes the highly efficient emission of yellow{\textminus}green light from substrate firefly luciferin by a sequence of reactions that require Mg-ATP and molecular oxygen. We had previously developed a working model of the luciferase active site based on the X-ray structure of the enzyme without bound substrates. In our model, the side chain guanidinium group of Arg218 appears to be located in close proximity to the substrate's hydroxyl group at the bottom of the luciferin binding pocket. A similar role for Arg337 also has been proposed. We report here the construction, purification, and characterization of mutant luciferases R218A, R218Q, R218K, R337Q, and R337K. Alteration of the Arg218 side chain produced enzymes with 15{\textminus}20-fold increases in the Km values for luciferin. The contrasting near-normal Km values for luciferin determined with the Arg337 enzymes support our proposal that Arg218 (and not Arg337) is an essential luciferin binding site residue.

abstract = {Beetle luciferases are thought to have evolved from fatty acyl-CoA synthetases present in all insects. Both classes of enzymes activate fatty acids with ATP to form acyl-adenylate intermediates, but only luciferases can activate and oxidize d-luciferin to emit light. Here we show that the Drosophila fatty acyl-CoA synthetase CG6178, which cannot use d-luciferin as a substrate, is able to catalyze light emission from the synthetic luciferin analog CycLuc2. Bioluminescence can be detected from the purified protein, live Drosophila Schneider 2 cells, and from mammalian cells transfected with CG6178. Thus, the nonluminescent fruit fly possesses an inherent capacity for bioluminescence that is only revealed upon treatment with a xenobiotic molecule. This result expands the scope of bioluminescence and demonstrates that the introduction of a new substrate can unmask latent enzymatic activity that differs significantly from an enzyme's normal function without requiring mutation.},

abstract = {Fibrosis, a disease in which excessive amounts of connective tissue accumulate in response to physical damage and/or inflammatory insult, affects nearly every tissue in the body and can progress to a state of organ malfunction and death. A hallmark of fibrotic disease is the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix-secreting activated myofibroblasts (MFBs) in place of functional parenchymal cells. As such, the identification of agents that selectively inhibit the transdifferentiation process leading to the formation of MFBs represents an attractive approach for the treatment of diverse fibrosis-related diseases. Herein we report the development of a high throughput image-based screen using primary hepatic stellate cells that identified the antifungal drug itraconazole (ITA) as an inhibitor of MFB cell fate in resident fibroblasts derived from multiple murine and human tissues (i.e., lung, liver, heart, and skin). Chemical optimization of ITA led to a molecule (CBR-096-4) devoid of antifungal and human cytochrome P450 inhibitory activity with excellent pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy in rodent models of lung, liver, and skin fibrosis. These findings may serve to provide a strategy for the safe and effective treatment of a broad range of fibrosis-related diseases.},

In this assay, a small-molecule yeast three-hybrid system is used to link enzyme catalysis to transcription of a reporter gene in vivo. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by using a well-studied enzyme-catalyzed reaction, cephalosporin hydrolysis by the Enterobacter cloacae P99 cephalosporinase (beta-lactam hydrolase, EC ). We show that the three-hybrid system can be used to read out cephalosporinase activity in vivo as a change in the level of transcription of a lacZ reporter gene and that the wild-type cephalosporinase can be isolated from a pool of inactive mutants by using a lacZ screen. The assay has been designed so that it can be applied to different chemical reactions without changing the components of the three-hybrid system. A reaction-independent high-throughput assay for protein function should be a powerful tool for protein engineering and enzymology, drug discovery, and proteomics.},

Applications have, however, been severely limited by the lack of a versatile STED-compatible two-colour labelling strategy for intracellular targets in living cells. Here we demonstrate a universal labelling method based on the organic, membrane-permeable dyes SiR and ATTO590 as Halo and SNAP substrates. SiR and ATTO590 constitute the first suitable dye pair for two-colour STED imaging in living cells below 50 nm resolution. We show applications with mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane and Golgi-localized proteins, and demonstrate continuous acquisition for up to 3 min at 2-s time resolution.},

Appropriate statistical analysis is important for the proper construction of these libraries and even more important for the interpretation of data from these libraries. We present simple mathematical expressions useful in the creation and evaluation of such libraries. These equations are useful in estimating the distribution of mutations, the degeneracy of the library and the frequency of a particular clone in the library. In addition, general equations addressing the probability that a particular clone is in a library, the probability that a library is complete, and as the consequences of retransformation of the library on these probabilities are presented.},

It makes use of the fluorescence-quenching properties of 1-methyladenine; removal of the alkyl group results in a >10-fold light-up signal. The probe is specific for ALKBH3 over its related homologue ALKBH2 and can be used to identify and measure the effectiveness of enzyme inhibitors. Measurements of the enzyme substrate parameters show that MAQ displays Km and kcat values essentially the same as those of the native substrate. Finally, we show that the probe functions efficiently in cells, allowing imaging and quantitation of ALKBH3 activity by microscopy and flow cytometry. We expect that MAQ probes will be broadly useful in the study of the basic biology of ALKBH3 and ...},

abstract = {All natural organisms store genetic information in a four-letter, two-base-pair genetic alphabet. The expansion of the genetic alphabet with two synthetic unnatural nucleotides that selectively pair to form an unnatural base pair (UBP) would increase the information storage potential of DNA, and semisynthetic organisms (SSOs) that stably harbor this expanded alphabet would thereby have the potential to store and retrieve increased information. Toward this goal, we previously reported that Escherichia coli grown in the presence of the unnatural nucleoside triphosphates dNaMTP and d5SICSTP, and provided with the means to import them via expression of a plasmid-borne nucleoside triphosphate transporter, replicates DNA containing a single dNaM-d5SICS UBP. Although this represented an important proof-of-concept, the nascent SSO grew poorly and, more problematically, required growth under controlled conditions and even then was unable to indefinitely store the unnatural information, which is clearly a prerequisite for true semisynthetic life. Here, to fortify and vivify the nascent SSO, we engineered the transporter, used a more chemically optimized UBP, and harnessed the power of the bacterial immune response by using Cas9 to eliminate DNA that had lost the UBP. The optimized SSO grows robustly, constitutively imports the unnatural triphosphates, and is able to indefinitely retain multiple UBPs in virtually any sequence context. This SSO is thus a form of life that can stably store genetic information using a six-letter, three-base-pair alphabet.},

abstract = {Overlap extension represents a new approach to genetic engineering. Complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) primers and the polymerase chain reaction are used to generate two DNA fragments having overlapping ends. These fragments are combined in a subsequent 'fusion' reaction in which the overlapping ends anneal, allowing the 3' overlap of each strand to serve as a primer for the 3' extension of the complementary strand. The resulting fusion product is amplified further by PCR. Specific alterations in the nucleotide (nt) sequence can be introduced by incorporating nucleotide changes into the overlapping oligo primers. Using this technique of site-directed mutagenesis, three variants of a mouse major histocompatibility complex class-I gene have been generated, cloned and analyzed. Screening of mutant clones revealed at least a 98% efficiency of mutagenesis. All clones sequenced contained the desired mutations, and a low frequency of random substitution estimated to occur at approx. 1 in 4000 nt was detected. This method represents a significant improvement over standard methods of site-directed mutagenesis because it is much faster, simpler and approaches 100% efficiency in the generation of mutant product.},

abstract = {The increased importance of in vivo diagnostics has posed new demands for imaging technologies. In that regard, there is a need for imaging molecules capable of expanding the applications of current state-of-the-art imaging in vivo diagnostics. To that end, there is a desire for new reporter molecules capable of providing strong signals, are non-toxic, and can be tailored to diagnose or monitor the progression of a number of diseases. Aequorin is a non-toxic photoprotein that can be used as a sensitive marker for bioluminescence in vivo imaging. The sensitivity of aequorin is due to the fact that bioluminescence is a rare phenomenon in nature and, therefore, it does not suffer from autofluorescence, which contributes to background emission. Emission of bioluminescence in the blue-region of the spectrum by aequorin only occurs when calcium, and its luciferin coelenterazine, are bound to the protein and trigger a biochemical reaction that results in light generation. It is this reaction that endows aequorin with unique characteristics, making it ideally suited for a number of applications in bioanalysis and imaging. Herein we report the site-specific incorporation of non-canonical or non-natural amino acids and several coelenterazine analogues, resulting in a catalog of 72 cysteine-free, aequorin variants which expand the potential applications of these photoproteins by providing several red-shifted mutants better suited to use in vivo. In vivo studies in mouse models using the transparent tissue of the eye confirmed the activity of the aequorin variants incorporating L-4-iodophehylalanine and L-4-methoxyphenylalanine after injection into the eye and topical addition of coelenterazine. The signal also remained localized within the eye. This is the first time that aequorin variants incorporating non-canonical amino acids have shown to be active in vivo and useful as reporters in bioluminescence imaging.},

abstract = {Appropriate integration of cellular signals requires a delicate balance of ligand-target binding affinities. Increasing the level of residual structure in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which are overrepresented in these cellular processes, has been shown previously to enhance binding affinities and alter cellular function. Conserved proline residues are commonly found flanking regions of IDPs that become helical upon interacting with a partner protein. Here, we mutate these helix-flanking prolines in p53 and MLL and find opposite effects on binding affinity upon an increase in free IDP helicity. In both cases, changes in affinity were due to alterations in dissociation, not association, rate constants, which is inconsistent with conformational selection mechanisms. We conclude that, contrary to previous suggestions, helix-flanking prolines do not regulate affinity by modulating the rate of complex formation. Instead, they influence binding affinities by controlling the lifetime of the bound complex.},

abstract = {The in vivo incorporation of non-natural amino acids into specific sites within proteins has become an extremely powerful tool for bio- and protein chemists in recent years. One avenue that has yet to be explored, however, is whether or not the incorporation of non-natural amino acids can tune the color of light emitted by bioluminescent proteins, whose light emission mechanisms are more complex and less well understood than their fluorescent counterparts. Bioluminescent proteins are becoming increasingly important in a variety of research fields, such as in situ imaging and the study of protein-protein interactions in vivo, and an increased spectral variety of bioluminescent reporters is needed for further progress. Thus, herein we report the first successful spectral shifting (44 nm) of a bioluminescent protein, aequorin, via the site-specific incorporation of several non-natural amino acids into an integral amino acid position within the aequorin structure in vivo.},

abstract = {Progress toward the development of minimally invasive liquid biopsies of disease is being bolstered by breakthroughs in the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA): DNA released from cancer cells into the bloodstream. However, robust, sensitive, and specific methods of detecting this emerging analyte are lacking. ctDNA analysis has unique challenges, since it is imperative to distinguish circulating DNA from normal cells vs mutation-bearing sequences originating from tumors. Here we report the electrochemical detection of mutated ctDNA in samples collected from cancer patients. By developing a strategy relying on the use of DNA clutch probes (DCPs) that render specific sequences of ctDNA accessible, we were able to readout the presence of mutated ctDNA. DCPs prevent reassociation of denatured DNA strands: they make one of the two strands of a dsDNA accessible for hybridization to a probe, and they also deactivate other closely related sequences in solution. DCPs ensure thereby that only mutated sequence...},

abstract = {The construction of synthetic gene circuits relies on our ability to engineer regulatory architectures that are orthogonal to the host's native regulatory pathways. However, as synthetic gene circuits become larger and more complicated, we are limited by the small number of parts, especially transcription factors, that work well in the context of the circuit. The current repertoire of transcription factors consists of a limited selection of activators and repressors, making the implementation of transcriptional logic a complicated and component-intensive process. To address this, we modified bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) to create a library of transcriptional AND gates for use in Escherichia coli by first splitting the protein and then mutating the DNA recognition domain of the C-terminal fragment to alter its promoter specificity. We first demonstrate that split T7 RNAP is active in vivo and compare it with full-length enzyme. We then create a library of mutant split T7 RNAPs that have a range of activities when used in combination with a complimentary set of altered T7-specific promoters. Finally, we assay the two-input function of both wild-type and mutant split T7 RNAPs and find that regulated expression of the N- and C-terminal fragments of the split T7 RNAPs creates AND logic in each case. This work demonstrates that mutant split T7 RNAP can be used as a transcriptional AND gate and introduces a unique library of components for use in synthetic gene circuits.},

abstract = {The neural crest is a source to produce multipotent neural crest stem cells that have a potential to differentiate into diverse cell types. The transcription factor SOX10 is expressed through early neural crest progenitors and stem cells in vertebrates. Here we report the generation of SOX10-Nano-lantern (NL) reporter human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS) by using CRISPR/Cas9 systems, that are beneficial to investigate the generation and maintenance of neural crest progenitor cells. SOX10-NL positive cells are produced transiently from hiPS cells by treatment with TGF$\beta$ inhibitor SB431542 and GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021. We found that all SOX10-NL-positive cells expressed an early neural crest marker NGFR, however SOX10-NL-positive cells purified from differentiated hiPS cells progressively attenuate their NL-expression under proliferation. We therefore attempted to maintain SOX10-NL-positive cells with additional signaling on the plane and sphere culture conditions. These SOX10-NL cells provide us to investigate mass culture with neural crest cells for stem cell research.},

Due to their role in normal physiology and pathophysiology, both enzymes have been identified as potential drug targets, but few useful inhibitors have been reported. Here, we find that 2-chloroacetamidine irreversibly inhibits both DDAH from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and human PAD4 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, despite the nonoverlapping substrate specificities and low levels of amino acid identity of their catalytic domains. Substrate protection experiments indicate that inactivation occurs by modification at the active site, albeit with modest affinity. Mass spectral analysis demonstrates that irreversible inactivation of DDAH occurs through selective formation of a covalent thioether bond with the active-site Cys249 residue. The mechanism of inactivation by 2-chloroacetamidine is analogous to that of c...},

However, protein-protein interactions are exceedingly difficult to inhibit. Small molecules lack sufficient steric bulk to prevent interactions between large peptide surfaces. To yield potent inhibitors of beta-amyloid (Abeta) aggregation, we synthesized small molecules that increase their steric bulk by binding to chaperones but also have a moiety available for interaction with Abeta. This strategy yields potent inhibitors of Abeta aggregation and could lead to therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of neurodegeneration.},

We validate complementation-based activation of split synthetic renilla luciferase protein driven by the interaction of two strongly interacting proteins, MyoD and Id, in five different cell lines utilizing transient transfection studies. The expression level of the system was also modulated by tumor necrosis factor alpha through NFkappaB-promoter/enhancer elements used to drive expression of the N portion of synthetic renilla luciferase reporter gene.

abstract = {PURPOSE:Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is a technique with a low background noise and high sensitivity which is widely used in mice models in oncology. We aimed to assess BLI efficiency of the new luciferase NanoLuc (Nluc) for glioblastoma cell lines and tumors, including for dual reporter applications of deep brain tumors and systemic metastasis when combined with firefly luciferase (Fluc).

PROCEDURES:U87 cells were genetically modified for constitutive production of either Nluc, Fluc, or both and assayed for luciferase activity and BLI on cell lysates, living cells, subcutaneous tumors, brain tumors, and systemic metastases.

RESULTS:In vitro, light production by Nluc activity is higher than Fluc. In vivo, Nluc allows for tumor detection including for deep brain tumors and systemic metastases.

CONCLUSIONS:Nluc appears to be a useful tool to combine with Fluc for dual imaging in vivo using bioluminescence, allowing for the detection of distinct events in deep tissues within the same organism.},

abstract = {The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) orchestrates dynamic recruitment of specific cellular machines during different stages of transcription. Signature phosphorylation patterns of Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 heptapeptide repeats of the CTD engage specific "readers." Whereas phospho-Ser5 and phospho-Ser2 marks are ubiquitous, phospho-Thr4 is reported to only impact specific genes. Here, we identify a role for phospho-Thr4 in transcription termination at noncoding small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes. Quantitative proteomics reveals an interactome of known readers as well as protein complexes that were not known to rely on Thr4 for association with Pol II. The data indicate a key role for Thr4 in engaging the machinery used for transcription elongation and termination. We focus on Rtt103, a protein that binds phospho-Ser2 and phospho-Thr4 marks and facilitates transcription termination at protein-coding genes. To elucidate how Rtt103 engages two distinct CTD modifications that are differentially enriched at noncoding genes, we relied on NMR analysis of Rtt103 in complex with phospho-Thr4- or phospho-Ser2-bearing CTD peptides. The structural data reveal that Rtt103 interacts with phospho-Thr4 in a manner analogous to its interaction with phospho-Ser2-modified CTD. The same set of hydrogen bonds involving either the oxygen on phospho-Thr4 and the hydroxyl on Ser2, or the phosphate on Ser2 and the Thr4 hydroxyl, can be formed by rotation of an arginine side chain, leaving the intermolecular interface otherwise unperturbed.

As the most conventional technique for BLI, the firefly luciferin-luciferase system is exceptionally functional in vitro and in vivo. The state-of-the-art strategy in such a system is to cage the luciferin, in which free luciferin is conjugated with distinctive functional groups, thus accommodating an impressive toolkit for exploring various biological processes, such as monitoring enzymes activity, detecting bioactive small molecules, evaluating the properties of molecular transporters, etc. This review article summarizes the rational design of caged luciferins towards diverse biotargets, as well as their applications in bioluminescent imaging. It should be emphasized that these caged luciferins can stretch out the applications of bioluminescence imaging and shed light upon understanding the pathogenesis of various diseases.},

Despite the power of bioluminescence for imaging and drug discovery, light emission from firefly luciferase is fundamentally limited by the physical properties of the D-luciferin substrate. We and others have synthesized aminoluciferin analogs that exhibit light emission at longer wavelengths than D-luciferin and have increased affinity for luciferase. However, although these substrates can emit an intense initial burst of light that approaches that of D-luciferin, this is followed by much lower levels of sustained light output. Here we describe the creation~of mutant luciferases that yield improved sustained light emission with aminoluciferins in both lysed and live mammalian cells, allowing the use of~aminoluciferins for cell-based bioluminescence experiments.},

Optimal ncAA-sfGFP synthesis correlates with improved aminoacylation kinetics for a tRNATyr amber suppressor with two substitutions in the anticodon loop (G34C/G37A), while four additional mutations in the D and variable loops, present in the tRNATyr used in all directed evolution experiments to date, are deleterious to function both i...},

abstract = {Bioluminescence using the reporter enzyme firefly luciferase (Fluc) and the substrate luciferin enables non-invasive optical imaging of living animals with extremely high sensitivity. This type of analysis enables studies of gene expression, tumor growth, and cell migration over time in live animals that were previously not possible. However, a major limitation of this system is that Fluc activity is restricted to the intracellular environment, which precludes important applications of in vivo imaging such as antibody labeling, or serum protein monitoring. In order to expand the application of bioluminescence imaging to other enzymes, we characterized a sequential reporter-enzyme luminescence (SRL) technology for the in vivo detection of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity. The substrate is a "caged" D-luciferin conjugate that must first be cleaved by beta-gal before it can be catalyzed by Fluc in the final, light-emitting step. Hence, luminescence is dependent on and correlates with beta-gal activity. A variety of experiments were performed in order to validate the system and explore potential new applications. We were able to visualize non-invasively over time constitutive beta-gal activity in engineered cells, as well as inducible tissue-specific beta-gal expression in transgenic mice. Since beta-gal, unlike Fluc, retains full activity outside of cells, we were able to show that antibodies conjugated to the recombinant beta-gal enzyme could be used to detect and localize endogenous cells and extracellular antigens in vivo. In addition, we developed a low-affinity beta-gal complementation system that enables inducible, reversible protein interactions to be monitored in real time in vivo, for example, sequential responses to agonists and antagonists of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Thus, using SRL, the exquisite luminescent properties of Fluc can be combined with the advantages of another enzyme. Other substrates have been described that extend the scope to endogenous enzymes, such as cytochromes or caspases, potentially enabling additional unprecedented applications.},

abstract = {Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its derivatives have transformed the use and analysis of proteins for diverse applications. Like proteins, RNA has complex roles in cellular function and is increasingly used for various applications, but a comparable approach for fluorescently tagging RNA is lacking. Here, we describe the generation of RNA aptamers that bind fluorophores resembling the fluorophore in GFP. These RNA-fluorophore complexes create a palette that spans the visible spectrum. An RNA-fluorophore complex, termed Spinach, resembles enhanced GFP and emits a green fluorescence comparable in brightness with fluorescent proteins. Spinach is markedly resistant to photobleaching, and Spinach fusion RNAs can be imaged in living cells. These RNA mimics of GFP provide an approach for genetic encoding of fluorescent RNAs.},

abstract = { A rapid and selective ligand-directed chemical reaction was developed for the acylation of proteins in living cells on the basis of ligand-directed chemistry. By fine tuning the reactivity and stability of the phenyl ester derivatives, we successfully identified ortho-dibromophenyl benzoate as the optimal reactive motif. It was sufficiently stable in an aqueous buffer, hydrolyzing less than 10% after 13 h of incubation, but reactive enough for efficient and selective protein labeling in living mammalian cells, as well as in vitro (referred to as ligand-directed dibromophenyl benzoate (LDBB) chemistry). Using this chemistry, various fluorophores can be tethered to the target protein directly, which allows fluorescence visualization of the labeled protein in live cells using different colored fluorophore groups (including coumarin, fluorescein and rhodamine). Furthermore, this labeling is applicable to not only an overexpressed protein (E. coli dihydrofolate reductase) but also endogenous human carbonic anhydrase II and XII under living cell conditions. LDBB chemistry is a new entry of ligand-directed protein labeling methods, and should be particularly useful for the imaging of natural proteins in living cells.},

abstract = {The creation of enzymes capable of catalyzing any desired chemical reaction is a grand challenge for computational protein design. Using new algorithms that rely on hashing techniques to construct active sites for multistep reactions, we designed retro-aldolases that use four different catalytic motifs to catalyze the breaking of a carbon-carbon bond in a nonnatural substrate. Of the 72 designs that were experimentally characterized, 32, spanning a range of protein folds, had detectable retro-aldolase activity. Designs that used an explicit water molecule to mediate proton shuffling were significantly more successful, with rate accelerations of up to four orders of magnitude and multiple turnovers, than those involving charged side-chain networks. The atomic accuracy of the design process was confirmed by the x-ray crystal structure of active designs embedded in two protein scaffolds, both of which were nearly superimposable on the design model.},

Among the five human PADs (PAD1, -2, -3, -4, and -6), it is unclear which isozyme contributes to disease pathogenesis. Toward the identification of potent, selective, and bioavailable PAD inhibitors that can be used to elucidate the specific roles of each isozyme, we describe tetrazole analogs as suitable backbone amide bond bioisosteres for the parent pan PAD inhibitor Cl-amidine. These tetrazole based analogs are highly potent and show selectivity toward particular isozymes. Importantly, one of the compounds, biphenyl tetrazole tert-butyl Cl-amidine (compound 13), exhibits enhanced cell killing in a PAD4 expressing osteosarcoma bone marrow (U2OS) cell line and can also b...},

abstract = {Luciferase exhibits a broad range of emitting frequencies. Light emission from the bioluminescence of luciferase makes it an excellent tool for monitoring gene expression, thus the control of its bioluminescence color has great bio-analytical applications. Here I use an elastic network model to examine how the sequence distribution of luciferase is related to bioluminescence multicolor emission. Based on the open and closed forms of crystal structures for luciferase, several computational analysis tools are applied to characterize the functionally relevant dynamical features within luciferase, and probe the dynamical mechanisms underlying the interactions between luciferin (a light-emitting substrate) and luciferase. Perturbation-based correlation analysis is used to identify hot-spot residues that are dynamically coupled to the active site of luciferase, and the results show that the sequence region of subdomain B of luciferase is largely responsible for determining the emitting color of bioluminescence. Moreover, the mode decomposition analysis reveals that the lowest frequency mode is the major contributor to the dynamical couplings between the hot-spot residues and the binding site in luciferase.},

Unfortunately, most luciferins are difficult to access and remain prohibitively expensive for some imaging applications. Here we report cost-effective and efficient syntheses of d-luciferin and 6'-aminoluciferin, two widely used bioluminescent substrates. Our approach employs inexpensive anilines and Appel's salt to generate the luciferin cores in a single pot. Additionally, the syntheses are scalable and can provide multi-gram quantities of both substrates. The streamlined production and improved accessibility of luciferin reagents will bolster in vivo imaging efforts.},

abstract = { 2-Hydroxyphenylthiazolines are a family of iron-chelating nonribosomal peptide natural products that function as virulence-conferring siderophores in various Gram-negative bacteria. They have also been reported as metabolites of Gram-positive Streptomyces species. Transcriptional analyses of Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712 revealed that its genome contains a putative 2-hydroxyphenylthiazoline biosynthetic gene cluster. Heterologous expression of the gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M1152 showed that the mono- and dimethylated derivatives, thiazostatin and watasemycin, respectively, of the well known 2-hydroxyphenylthiazoline pyochelin are two of its metabolic products. In addition, isopyochelin, a novel isomer of pyochelin containing a C-methylated thiazolidine, was identified as a third metabolic product of the cluster. Metabolites with molecular formulae corresponding to aerugine and pulicatins A/B were also detected. The structure and stereochemistry of isopyochelin were confirmed by comparison with synthetic standards. The role of two genes in the cluster encoding homologues of PchK, which is proposed to catalyse thiazoline reduction in the biosynthesis of enantiopyochelin in Pseudomonas protegens, was investigated. One was required for the production of all the metabolic products of the cluster, whereas the other appears not to be involved in the biosynthesis of any of them. Deletion of a gene in the cluster encoding a type B radical-SAM methylase homolouge abolished the production of watasemycin, but not thiazostatin or isopyochelin. Feeding of thiazostatin to the mutant lacking the functional PchK homologue resulted in complete conversion to watasemycin, demonstrating that thiazoline C-methylation by the type B radical-SAM methylase homologue is the final step in watasemycin biosynthesis.},

Initially detected foci could expand locally, seed other sites in BM or spleen, and/or recede with different kinetics.

Qrr1-5 use four different regulatory mechanisms to control the expression of ∼ 20 mRNA targets. Little is known about the roles individual nucleotides play in mRNA target selection, in determining regulatory mechanism, or in defining Qrr potency and dynamics of target regulation. To identify the nucleotides vital for Qrr function, we developed a method we call RSort-Seq that combines saturating mutagenesis, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, high-throughput sequencing, and mutual information theory to explore the role that every nucleotide in Qrr4 plays in regulation of two mRNA targets, luxR and luxO. Companion biochemical assays allowed us to assign specific regulatory functions/underlying molecular mechanisms to each important base. This strategy yielded a regional map of nucleotides in Qrr4 vital for stability, Hfq interaction, stem-loop formation, and base pairing to both luxR and luxO, to luxR only, and to luxO only. In terms of nucleotides critical for sRNA function, the RSort-Seq analysis provided strikingly different results from those predicted by commonly used regulatory RNA-folding algorithms. This approach is applicable to any RNA-RNA interaction, including sRNAs in other bacteria and regulatory RNAs in higher organisms.},

Our procedure utilizes a relatively rare, but synthetically useful dithiazolium reagent to generate heteroaromatic scaffolds in a divergent fashion. Two of the luciferin analogues produced with this approach emit light with Fluc in vitro and in live cells. Collectively, our work increases the number of substrates that can be used for bioluminescence imaging and provides a general strategy for synthesizing new collections of luciferins.},

abstract = {Bacterial glycans contain rare, exclusively bacterial monosaccharides that are frequently linked to pathogenesis and essentially absent from human cells. Therefore, bacterial glycans are intriguing molecular targets. However, systematic discovery of bacterial glycoproteins is hampered by the presence of rare deoxy amino sugars, which are refractory to traditional glycan-binding reagents. Thus, the development of chemical tools that label bacterial glycans is a crucial step toward discovering and targeting these biomolecules. Here, we explore the extent to which metabolic glycan labeling facilitates the studying and targeting of glycoproteins in a range of pathogenic and symbiotic bacterial strains. We began with an azide-containing analog of the naturally abundant monosaccharide N-acetylglucosamine and discovered that it is not broadly incorporated into bacterial glycans, thus revealing a need for additional azidosugar substrates to broaden the utility of metabolic glycan labeling in bacteria. Therefore, we designed and synthesized analogs of the rare deoxy amino d-sugars N-acetylfucosamine, bacillosamine, and 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxygalactose and established that these analogs are differentially incorporated into glycan-containing structures in a range of pathogenic and symbiotic bacterial species. Further application of these analogs will refine our knowledge of the glycan repertoire in diverse bacteria and may find utility in treating a variety of infectious diseases with selectivity.},

abstract = {The regulatory approval of ipilimumab (Yervoy) in 2011 ushered in a new era of cancer immunotherapies with durable clinical effects. Most of these breakthrough medicines are monoclonal antibodies that block protein-protein interactions between T cell checkpoint receptors and their cognate ligands. In addition, genetically engineered autologous T cell therapies have also recently demonstrated significant clinical responses in haematological cancers. Conspicuously missing from this class of therapies are traditional small-molecule drugs, which have previously served as the backbone of targeted cancer therapies. Modulating the immune system through a small-molecule approach offers several unique advantages that are complementary to, and potentially synergistic with, biologic modalities. This Review highlights immuno-oncology pathways and mechanisms that can be best or solely targeted by small-molecule medicines. Agents aimed at these mechanisms--modulation of the immune response, trafficking to the tumour microenvironment and cellular infiltration--are poised to significantly extend the scope of immuno-oncology applications and enhance the opportunities for combination with tumour-targeted agents and biologic immunotherapies.},

abstract = {The total chemical synthesis of proteins has great potential for increasing our understanding of the molecular basis of protein function. The introduction of native chemical ligation techniques to join unprotected peptides next to a cysteine residue has greatly facilitated the synthesis of proteins of moderate size. Here, we describe a straightforward methodology that has enabled us to rapidly analyze the compatibility of the native chemical ligation strategy for X-Cys ligation sites, where X is any of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. The simplified methodology avoids the necessity of specific amino acid thioester linkers or alkylation of C-terminal thioacid peptides. Experiments using matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization MS analysis of combinatorial ligations of LYRAX-C-terminal thioester peptides to the peptide CRANK show that all 20 amino acids are suitable for ligation, with Val, Ile, and Pro representing less favorable choices because of slow ligation rates. To illustrate the method's utility, two 124-aa proteins were manually synthesized by using a three-step, four-piece ligation to yield a fully active human secretory phospholipase A(2) and a catalytically inactive analog. The combination of flexibility in design with general access because of simplified methodology broadens the applicability and versatility of chemical protein synthesis.},

abstract = {Split reporter-based bioluminescence imaging is a useful strategy for studying protein{\textminus}protein as well as other intracellular interactions. We have used a combinatorial strategy to identify a novel split site for firefly luciferase with improved characteristics over previously published split sites. A combination of fragments with greater absolute signal with near-zero background signals was achieved by screening 115 different combinations. The identified fragments were further characterized by using five different interacting protein partners and an intramolecular folding strategy. Cell culture studies and imaging in living mice was performed to validate the new split sites. In addition, the signal generated by the newly identified combination of fragments (Nfluc 398/ Cfluc 394) was compared with different split luciferase fragments currently in use for studying protein{\textminus}protein interactions and was shown to be markedly superior with a lower self-complementation signal and equal or higher postinteraction ...},

abstract = {Riboswitches regulate genes through structural changes in ligand-binding RNA aptamers. With the use of an optical-trapping assay based on in situ transcription by a molecule of RNA polymerase, single nascent RNAs containing pbuE adenine riboswitch aptamers were unfolded and refolded. Multiple folding states were characterized by means of both force-extension curves and folding trajectories under constant force by measuring the molecular contour length, kinetics, and energetics with and without adenine. Distinct folding steps correlated with the formation of key secondary or tertiary structures and with ligand binding. Adenine-induced stabilization of the weakest helix in the aptamer, the mechanical switch underlying regulatory action, was observed directly. These results provide an integrated view of hierarchical folding in an aptamer, demonstrating how complex folding can be resolved into constituent parts, and supply further insights into tertiary structure formation.},

Here we report that wild-type E. coli EF-Tu and phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase collaborate with these mutant ribosomes and others to incorporate $\beta$(3)-Phe analogs into full length DHFR in vivo. E. coli harboring the most active mutant ribosomes are robust, with a doubling time only 14% longer than wild-type. These results reveal the unexpected tolerance of E. coli and its translation machinery to the $\beta$(3)-amino acid backbone and should embolden in vivo selections for orthogonal translational machinery components that incorporate diverse $\beta$-amino acids into proteins and peptides. E. coli harboring mutant ribosomes may possess the capacity to incorporate many non-natural, non-$\alpha$-amino acids into proteins and other sequence-programmed polymeric materials.},

abstract = {Chemokine CXCL12 (CXC chemokine ligand 12) signalling through CXCR (CXC chemokine receptor) 4 and CXCR7 has essential functions in development and underlies diseases including cancer, atherosclerosis and autoimmunity. Chemokines may form homodimers that regulate receptor binding and signalling, but previous studies with synthetic CXCL12 have produced conflicting evidence for homodimerization. We used bioluminescence imaging with GL ( Gaussia luciferase) fusions to investigate dimerization of CXCL12 secreted from mammalian cells. Using column chromatography and GL complementation, we established that CXCL12 was secreted from mammalian cells as both monomers and dimers. Secreted CXCL12 also formed homodimers in the extracellular space. Monomeric CXCL12 preferentially activated CXCR4 signalling through G$\alpha$i and Akt, whereas dimeric CXCL12 more effectively promoted recruitment of $\beta$-arrestin 2 to CXCR4 and chemotaxis of CXCR4-expressing breast cancer cells. We also showed that CXCR7 preferentially sequestered monomeric CXCL12 from the extracellular space and had minimal effects on dimeric CXCL12 in cell-based assays and an orthotopic tumour xenograft model of human breast cancer. These studies establish that CXCL12 secreted from mammalian cells forms homodimers under physiological conditions. Since monomeric and dimeric CXCL12 have distinct effects on cell signalling and function, our results have important implications for ongoing efforts to target CXCL12 pathways for therapy.

abstract = {Developing tissues contain motile populations of cells that can self-organize into spatially ordered tissues based on differences in their interfacial surface energies. However, it is unclear how self-organization by this mechanism remains robust when interfacial energies become heterogeneous in either time or space. The ducts and acini of the human mammary gland are prototypical heterogeneous and dynamic tissues comprising two concentrically arranged cell types. To investigate the consequences of cellular heterogeneity and plasticity on cell positioning in the mammary gland, we reconstituted its self-organization from aggregates of primary cells in vitro. We find that self-organization is dominated by the interfacial energy of the tissue-ECM boundary, rather than by differential homo- and heterotypic energies of cell-cell interaction. Surprisingly, interactions with the tissue-ECM boundary are binary, in that only one cell type interacts appreciably with the boundary. Using mathematical modeling and cell-type-specific knockdown of key regulators of cell-cell cohesion, we show that this strategy of self-organization is robust to severe perturbations affecting cell-cell contact formation. We also find that this mechanism of self-organization is conserved in the human prostate. Therefore, a binary interfacial interaction with the tissue boundary provides a flexible and generalizable strategy for forming and maintaining the structure of two-component tissues that exhibit abundant heterogeneity and plasticity. Our model also predicts that mutations affecting binary cell-ECM interactions are catastrophic and could contribute to loss of tissue architecture in diseases such as breast cancer.},

abstract = {In addition to their degradative role in protein turnover, proteases play a key role as positive or negative regulators of signal transduction pathways and therefore their dysregulation contributes to many disease states. Regulatory roles of proteases include their hormone-like role in triggering G protein-coupled signaling (Protease-Activated-Receptors); their role in shedding of ligands such as EGF, Notch and Fas; and their role in signaling events that lead to apoptotic cell death. Dysregulated activation of apoptosis by the caspase family of proteases has been linked to diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity and inflammation. In an effort to better understand the role of proteases in health and disease, a luciferase biosensor is described which can quantitatively report proteolytic activity in live cells and mouse models. The biosensor, hereafter referred to as GloSensor Caspase 3/7 has a robust signal to noise (50-100 fold) and dynamic range such that it can be used to screen for pharmacologically active compounds in high throughput campaigns as well as to study cell signaling in rare cell populations such as isolated cancer stem cells. The biosensor can also be used in the context of genetically engineered mouse models of human disease wherein conditional expression using the Cre/loxP technology can be implemented to investigate the role of a specific protease in living subjects. While the regulation of apoptosis by caspase's was used as an example in these studies, biosensors to study additional proteases involved in the regulation of normal and pathological cellular processes can be designed using the concepts presented herein.},

Vertical and adiabatic excitation energies have been computed for the npi and pipi states. Overall, we have found that both RI-CC2 and TDDFT methods are good candidates for the description of ESIPT potential energy surfaces. Proton transfer (PT) curves have been computed for both excited states. An essentially barrierless and very shallow energy profile has been found for the pi pi* state. For the n pi* state the keto minimum is more pronounced than for the pi pi* state and, depending on the case, energy barriers ranging from values <0.1 eV up to 0.5 eV were found. From the computed PT curves we conclude that extended crossing regions between the two excited states will occur.},

Phenolate anion 1-O{\textminus} is a model compound for the keto form of wild-type oxyluciferin phenolate anion (OL{\textminus}), which is postulated to be the emitter of the bioluminescence. The fluorescence maxima of 1-O{\textminus} were found to depend on the base/solvent combination used, and they varied in the range 541{\textminus}640 nm, which covers the almost whole range of the bioluminescence emission maximum. In a polar solvent, where 1(1-O{\textminus})* and the countercation (the conjugate acid of a base) make a solvent-separated ion pair or a free ion couple, the emission maxima of 1-O{\textminus} were found to be modulated by the solvent polarity.

abstract = {The network of activator protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that underpin transcription initiation is poorly defined, particularly in the cellular context. The transient nature of these contacts and the often low abundance of the participants present significant experimental hurdles. Through the coupling of in vivo covalent chemical capture and shotgun LC-MS/MS (MuDPIT) analysis, we can trap the PPIs of transcriptional activators in a cellular setting and identify the binding partners in an unbiased fashion. Using this approach, we discover that the prototypical activators Gal4 and VP16 target the Snf1 (AMPK) kinase complex via direct interactions with both the core enzymatic subunit Snf1 and the exchangeable subunit Gal83. Further, we use a tandem reversible formaldehyde and irreversible covalent chemical capture approach (TRIC) to capture the Gal4-Snf1 interaction at the Gal1 promoter in live yeast. Together, these data support a critical role for activator PPIs in both the recruitment and positioning of important enzymatic complexes at a gene promoter and represent a technical advancement in the discovery of new cellular binding targets of transcriptional activators.},

The fungal luciferin does not share structural similarity with the other eight known luciferins.

abstract = {Hydrotropes are small molecules that solubilize hydrophobic molecules in aqueous solutions. Typically, hydrotropes are amphiphilic molecules and differ from classical surfactants in that they have low cooperativity of aggregation and work at molar concentrations. Here, we show that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has properties of a biological hydrotrope. It can both prevent the formation of and dissolve previously formed protein aggregates. This chemical property is manifested at physiological concentrations between 5 and 10 millimolar. Therefore, in addition to being an energy source for biological reactions, for which micromolar concentrations are sufficient, we propose that millimolar concentrations of ATP may act to keep proteins soluble. This may in part explain why ATP is maintained in such high concentrations in cells.},

abstract = {We present a simple method for rapid and automatic characterization of lymphocyte migration from time-lapse fluorescence microscopy data. Time-lapse imaging of natural killer (NK) cells in vitro and in situ, both showed that individual cells transiently alter their migration behavior. Typically, NK cells showed periods of high motility, interrupted by transient periods of slow migration or almost complete arrests. Analysis of in vitro data showed that these periods frequently coincided with contacts with target cells, sometimes leading to target cell lysis. However, NK cells were also commonly observed to stop independently of contact with other cells. In order to objectively characterize the migration of NK cells, we implemented a simple method to discriminate when NK cells stop or have low motilities, have periods of directed migration or undergo random movement. This was achieved using a sliding window approach and evaluating the mean squared displacement (MSD) to assess the migration coefficient and MSD curvature along trajectories from individual NK cells over time. The method presented here can be used to quickly and quantitatively assess the dynamics of individual cells as well as heterogeneity within ensembles. Furthermore, it may also be used as a tool to automatically detect transient stops due to the formation of immune synapses, cell division or cell death. We show that this could be particularly useful for analysis of in situ time-lapse fluorescence imaging data where most cells, as well as the extracellular matrix, are usually unlabelled and thus invisible.},

abstract = {Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) systems to date have been dominated by use of blue-green Renilla luciferase (Rluc) as the energy donor. Although effective in many cases, the expense and unfavorable biochemical attributes of the substrate (phenylcoelenterazine) limit utility of Rluc-based BRET systems. Herein we report a series of novel BRET pairs based on luciferases that utilize D-luciferin, resulting in red-shifted photonic outputs, favorable biochemical attributes, and increased efficacy. We developed a modified F{\"o}rster equation to predict optimal BRET luciferase donor-fluorophore pairs and identified tdTomato as the optimal red fluorophore acceptor for click beetle green luciferase (CBG). A prototypical single-chain protease biosensor, capable of reporting on executioner caspase activity in live cells and in real-time, was generated by inserting a DEVD linker between CBG and tdTomato and validated in vitro with recombinant caspases and in cellulo with apoptosis-sensitive and -resistant cell lines. High signal-to-noise ratios ( approximately 33) and Z' factors (0.85) were observed in live cell longitudinal studies, sufficient for high-throughput screening. Thus, we illustrate a general methodology for the rational design of new BRET systems and provide a novel single-chain BRET protease biosensor that is long lived, red-shifted, and utilizes D-luciferin.},

abstract = {Neurexin and neuroligin are transmembrane adhesion proteins that play an important role in organizing the neuronal synaptic cleft. Our lab previously reported a method for imaging the trans-synaptic binding of neurexin and neuroligin called BLINC (Biotin Labeling of INtercellular Contacts). In BLINC, biotin ligase (BirA) is fused to one protein while its 15-amino acid acceptor peptide substrate (AP) is fused to the binding partner. When the two fusion proteins interact across cellular junctions, BirA catalyzes the site-specific biotinylation of AP, which can be read out by staining with streptavidin-fluorophore conjugates. Here, we report that BLINC in neurons cannot be reproduced using the reporter constructs and labeling protocol previously described. We uncover the technical reasons for the lack of reproducibilty and then re-design the BLINC reporters and labeling protocol to achieve neurexin-neuroligin BLINC imaging in neuron cultures. In addition, we introduce a new method, based on lipoic acid ligase instead of biotin ligase, to image trans-cellular neurexin-neuroligin interactions in human embryonic kidney cells and in neuron cultures. This method, called ID-PRIME for Interaction-Dependent PRobe Incorporation Mediated by Enzymes, is more robust than BLINC due to higher surface expression of lipoic acid ligase fusion constructs, gives stronger and more localized labeling, and is more versatile than BLINC in terms of signal readout. ID-PRIME expands the toolkit of methods available to study trans-cellular protein-protein interactions in living systems.},

abstract = {Bioluminescence imaging with luciferase-luciferin pairs is widely used in biomedical research. Several luciferases have been identified in nature, and many have been adapted for tracking cells in whole animals. Unfortunately, the optimal luciferases for imaging in vivo utilize the same substrate and therefore cannot easily differentiate multiple cell types in a single subject. To develop a broader set of distinguishable probes, we crafted custom luciferins that can be selectively processed by engineered luciferases. Libraries of mutant enzymes were iteratively screened with sterically modified luciferins, and orthogonal enzyme-substrate "hits" were identified. These tools produced light when complementary enzyme-substrate partners interacted both in vitro and in cultured cell models. Based on their selectivity, these designer pairs will bolster multicomponent imaging and enable the direct interrogation of cell networks not currently possible with existing tools. Our screening platform is also general and will expedite the identification of more unique luciferases and luciferins, further expanding the bioluminescence toolkit.},

abstract = {Nucleoside analogs (NAs) represent an important category of prodrugs for the treatment of viral infections and cancer, yet the biological potency of many analogs is compromised by their inefficient activation through cellular 2'-deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dNKs). We herein report the directed evolution and characterization of an orthogonal NA kinase for 3'-deoxythymidine (ddT), using a new FACS-based screening protocol in combination with a fluorescent analog of ddT. Four rounds of random mutagenesis and DNA shuffling of Drosophila melanogaster 2'-deoxynucleoside kinase, followed by FACS analysis, yielded an orthogonal ddT kinase with a 6-fold higher activity for the NA and a 20-fold k(cat)/K(M) preference for ddT over thymidine, an overall 10,000-fold change in substrate specificity. The contributions of individual amino acid substitutions in the ddT kinase were evaluated by reverse engineering, enabling a detailed structure-function analysis to rationalize the observed changes in performance. Based on our results, kinase engineering with fluorescent NAs and FACS should prove a highly versatile method for evolving selective kinase:NA pairs and for studying fundamental aspects of the structure-function relationship in dNKs.},

abstract = {Firefly luciferase is widely used in a number of areas of biotechnology and molecular biology. However, rapid inactivation of wild-type (WT) luciferases at elevated temperatures often hampers their application. A simple non-lethal in vivo screening scheme was used to identify thermostable mutants of luciferase in Escherichia coli colonies. This scheme allowed carrying out each cycle of mutagenesis in a rapid and efficient manner. Four rounds of directed evolution were conducted on a part of the gene coding for amino acid residues 130-390 of Luciola mingrelica luciferase. The resultant mutant designated 4TS had a half-life of 10 h at 42{\textdegree}C, which is 65-fold higher compared with the WT luciferase. Moreover, the mutant 4TS showed a 1.9-fold increase in specific activity, 5.7-fold reduction of K(m) for ATP and a higher-temperature optimum compared with the WT enzyme. 4TS contains eight mutations, four~of which are suggested to be mainly responsible for the enhancement of thermostability: R211L, A217V, E356K and S364C. Thus, directed evolution with non-lethal colony screening for in vivo bioluminescence activity proved to be an effective and efficient approach for increasing thermal stability of luciferase while retaining high catalytic activity.},

abstract = {Firefly luciferase catalyzes the highly efficient emission of yellow-green light from substrate firefly luciferin by a sequence of reactions that require Mg-ATP and molecular oxygen. We had previously developed [Branchini, B. R., Magyar, R. A., Murtiashaw, M. H., Anderson, S. M., and Zimmer, M. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 15311-15319] a molecular graphics-based working model of the luciferase active site starting with the first X-ray structure [Conti, E., Franks, N. P., and Brick, P. (1996) Structure 4, 287-298] of the enzyme without bound substrates. In our model, the luciferin binding site contains 15 residues that are within 5 A of the substrate. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we made changes at all of these residues and report here the characterization of the corresponding expressed and purified proteins. Of the 15 residues studied, 12 had a significantly (>or=4-fold K(m) difference) altered binding affinity for luciferin and seven residues, spanning the primary sequence region Arg218-Ala348, had substantially (>or=30 nm) red-shifted bioluminescence emission maxima when mutated. We report here an interpretation of the roles of the mutated residues in substrate binding and bioluminescence color determination. The results of this study generally substantiate the accuracy of our model and provide the foundation for future experiments designed to alter the substrate specificity of firefly luciferase.},

abstract = {Saturation mutagenesis probes define sections of the vast protein sequence space. However, even if randomization is limited this way, the combinatorial numbers problem is severe. Because diversity is created at the codon level, codon redundancy is a crucial factor determining the necessary effort for library screening. Additionally, due to the probabilistic nature of the sampling process, oversampling is required to ensure library completeness as well as a high probability to encounter all unique variants. Our trick employs a special mixture of three primers, creating a degeneracy of 22 unique codons coding for the 20 canonical amino acids. Therefore, codon redundancy and subsequent screening effort is significantly reduced, and a balanced distribution of codon per amino acid is achieved, as demonstrated exemplarily for a library of cyclohexanone monooxygenase. We show that this strategy is suitable for any saturation mutagenesis methodology to generate less-redundant libraries.},

The QD were phase transferred to aqueous buffers using a histidine mediated phase transfer route, and incubated with a hexahistidine tagged, green emitting variant of firefly luciferase from Photinus pyralis (PPyGRTS). The PPyGRTS were bound to the QD interface via the hexahistidine tag, which effectively displaces the histidine layer and binds directly to the QD interfaces, allowing for short donor{\textendash}acceptor distances (∼5.5 nm). Due to this, high BRET efficiency ratios of ∼5 were obtained. These PPyGRTS-QD bio-nano conjugates were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and BRET emission studies. The final optimized conjugate was easily observable by night vision imaging, demonstrating the potential of these materials in imaging and signaling/sensing applications.},

One promising new approach towards this problem exploits the phenomenon of 'surface borrowing,' in which the small molecule is presented to the RNA in complex with a protein, thereby expanding the overall surface area available for interaction with RNA. To extend the utility of surface borrowing to include potential applications in synthetic biology, we set out to create an 'orthogonal' RNA-targeting system, one in which all components are foreign to the cell. Here we report the identification of small RNA modules selected in vitro to bind a surface-engineered protein, but only when the two macromolecules are bound to a synthetic bifunctional small molecule.},

However, the emission maximum ($\lambda$max) of bioluminescence produced by D-luciferin is 562 nm where light is not highly penetrable in biological tissues. This emphasizes a need for developing a red-shifted bioluminescence imaging system to improve detection sensitivity of targets in deep tissue. Here we characterize the bioluminescent properties of the newly synthesized luciferin analogue, AkaLumine-HCl. The bioluminescence produced by AkaLumine-HCl in reactions with native firefly luciferase is in the near-infrared wavelength ranges ($\lambda$max=677 nm), and yields significantly increased target-detection sensitivity from deep tissues with maximal signals attained at very low concentrations, as compared with D-luciferin and emerging synthetic luciferin CycLuc1. These characteristics offer a more sensitive and accurate method for non-invasive bioluminescence imaging with native firefly luciferase in various animal models.},

abstract = {Light emission from the North American firefly Photinus pyralis, which emits yellow-green (557-nm) light, is widely believed to be the most efficient bioluminescence system known, making this luciferase an excellent tool for monitoring gene expression. Here, we present studies leading to the production of a set of red- and green-emitting luciferase mutants with bioluminescent properties suitable for expanding the use of the P. pyralis system to dual-color reporter assays, biosensor measurements with internal controls, and imaging techniques. Using a combination of mutagenesis methods, we determined that the Ser284Thr mutation was sufficient to create an excellent red-emitting luciferase with a bioluminescence maximum of 615 nm, a narrow emission bandwidth, and favorable kinetic properties. Also, we developed a luciferase, containing the changes Val241Ile, Gly246Ala, and Phe250Ser, whose emission maximum was blue-shifted to 549 nm, providing a set of enzymes whose bioluminescence maxima were separated by 66 nm. Model studies demonstrated that in assays using a set of optical filters, the luciferases could be detected at the attomole level and seven orders of magnitude higher. In addition, in the presence of the Ser284Thr enzyme serving as a control, green light emission could be measured over a 10,000-fold range. The results presented here with the P. pyralis mutants provide evidence that simultaneous multiple analyte assay development is feasible with these novel proteins that require only a single substrate.},

TDF (the bioavailable prodrug of tenofovir) is hydrolyzed to tenofovir intracellularly and phosphorylated to the active metabolite, tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir is a nucleotide analog of deoxyadenosine monophosphate, with activity against HIV-1, -2 and hepatitis B virus. FTC, the fluorinated derivative of lamivudine, is an analog of deoxycitidine, active against HIV-1, -2 and hepatitis B virus. Their long half-lives in plasma and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells allow once-daily dosing. Both are eliminated renally. Resistance mutation K65R is selected for by tenofovir and confers a two- to fourfold reduced susceptibility to this drug. The incidence of K65R is low (3%) and has not been observed in clinical trials with the concomitant use of tenofovir a...},

abstract = {The discovery of light-inducible protein-protein interactions has allowed for the spatial and temporal control of a variety of biological processes. To be effective, a photodimerizer should have several characteristics: it should show a large change in binding affinity upon light stimulation, it should not cross-react with other molecules in the cell, and it should be easily used in a variety of organisms to recruit proteins of interest to each other. To create a switch that meets these criteria we have embedded the bacterial SsrA peptide in the C-terminal helix of a naturally occurring photoswitch, the light-oxygen-voltage 2 (LOV2) domain from Avena sativa. In the dark the SsrA peptide is sterically blocked from binding its natural binding partner, SspB. When activated with blue light, the C-terminal helix of the LOV2 domain undocks from the protein, allowing the SsrA peptide to bind SspB. Without optimization, the switch exhibited a twofold change in binding affinity for SspB with light stimulation. Here, we describe the use of computational protein design, phage display, and high-throughput binding assays to create an improved light inducible dimer (iLID) that changes its affinity for SspB by over 50-fold with light stimulation. A crystal structure of iLID shows a critical interaction between the surface of the LOV2 domain and a phenylalanine engineered to more tightly pin the SsrA peptide against the LOV2 domain in the dark. We demonstrate the functional utility of the switch through light-mediated subcellular localization in mammalian cell culture and reversible control of small GTPase signaling.},

abstract = { Due to the formation of hydrolysis-susceptible adducts, the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between an azide and strained trans-cyclooctene (TCO) has been disregarded in the field of bioorthogonal chemistry. We report a method which uses the instability of the adducts to our advantage in a prodrug activation strategy. The reaction of trans-cyclooctenol (TCO-OH) with a model prodrug resulted in a rapid 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with second-order rates of 0.017 M{\textminus}1 s{\textminus}1 and 0.027 M{\textminus}1 s{\textminus}1 for the equatorial and axial isomers, respectively, resulting in release of the active compound. 1H NMR studies showed that activation proceeded via a triazoline and imine, both of which are rapidly hydrolyzed to release the model drug. Cytotoxicity of a doxorubicin prodrug was restored in vitro upon activation with TCO-OH, while with cis-cyclooctenol (CCO-OH) no activation was observed. The data also demonstrates the potential of this reaction in organic synthesis as a mild orthogonal protecting group strategy for amino and hydroxyl groups.},

However, results on the cellular internalization efficacy of CPPs obtained from various laboratories are sometimes challenging to compare because of differences in the experimental setups. Here, for the first time, the cellular uptake kinetics of eight well-established CPPs is compared in HeLa pLuc 705 cells using a recently published releasable luciferin assay. Using this assay, the kinetic behavior of cytosolic entry of these luciferin{\textminus}CPP conjugates are registered in real time. Our data reveal that the uptake rate of CPPs reaches its maximum either in seconds or in tens of minutes, depending on the CPP used. Tat and higher concentrations of MAP and TP10 display fast internalization profiles that resemble the kinetic profile of membrane-permeable free luciferin.

abstract = {ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a group of transmembrane proteins that maintain chemical homeostasis through efflux of compounds out of organelles and cells. Among other functions, ABC transporters play a key role in protecting the brain parenchyma by efflux of xenobiotics from capillary endothelial cells at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). They also prevent the entry of therapeutic drugs at the BBB, thereby limiting their efficacy. One of the key transporters playing this role is ABCG2. Although other ABC transporters can be studied through various imaging modalities, no specific probe exists for imaging ABCG2 function in vivo. Here we show that D-luciferin, the endogenous substrate of firefly luciferase, is a specific substrate for ABCG2. We hypothesized that ABCG2 function at the BBB could be evaluated by using bioluminescence imaging in transgenic mice expressing firefly luciferase in the brain. Bioluminescence signal in the brain of mice increased with coadministration of the ABCG2 inhibitors Ko143, gefitinib, and nilotinib, but not an ABCB1 inhibitor. This method for imaging ABCG2 function at the BBB will facilitate understanding of the function and pharmacokinetic inhibition of this transporter.},

abstract = {NK cells have potential therapeutic impact in suppressing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and enhancing antitumor effects as a cellular therapy for hematologic malignancies. However, few studies have addressed the trafficking and in vivo behavior of NK cells in murine models of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We investigated NK cell trafficking and survival following allogeneic and syngeneic BMT using a novel bioluminescence-based imaging strategy. Transplantation of luciferase-expressing NK cells revealed CD62L-mediated trafficking to lymphoid organs and trafficking to GVHD target tissues, as evidenced by in vivo and ex vivo bioluminescence imaging. The NK cells persisted for ∼4 wk after transplantation in allogeneic recipients, but were not detectable in syngeneic recipients. CFSE-labeling studies showed extensive NK cell proliferation in vivo. Transplanted NK cells up-regulated molecules necessary for homing to the lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, yet did not cause clinical GVHD. This expansion and tissue-specific homing was not solely due to the conditioning regimen, as NK cells proliferated and reached lymphoid and GVHD target tissue in unconditioned allogeneic RAG2{\textminus}/{\textminus} $\gamma$-chain{\textminus}/{\textminus} recipients. IL-2 enhanced expansion and antitumor activity of NK cells. These results provide significant insight into the behavior and potential therapeutic impact of NK cells in BMT.},

The luciferase enzyme from the North American firefly, which produces yellow{\textminus}green light, is a key component of many of these applications. Recognizing the heightened interest in the potential of near-infrared (nIR) light to improve these technologies, we have demonstrated that spectral emissions with maxima of 705 and 783 nm can be efficiently produced by a firefly luciferase variant covalently labeled with nIR fluorescent dyes. In one case, an outstanding BRET ratio of 34.0 was achieved emphasizing the importance of selective labeling with fluorescent dyes and the efficiency provided by the intramolecular BRET process. Additionally, we constructed a biotinylated fusion protein that similarly produced nIR light. This novel material was immobilized on solid supports ...},

Recent trends reveal their ever-increasing deployment within living systems as delivery devices that not only probe but also program and re-program a cell, or even whole organisms. Given that DNA is highly immunogenic, we outline the molecular, cellular and organismal response pathways that designer nucleic acid nanodevices are likely to elicit in living systems. We address safety issues applicable when such designer DNA nanodevices interact with the immune system. In light of this, we discuss possible molecular programming strategies that could be integrated with such designer nucleic acid scaffolds to either evade or stimulate the host response with a view to optimizing and widening their applications in higher organisms.},

abstract = {Pathogenic microbes have evolved complex secretion systems to deliver virulence factors into host cells. Identification of these factors is critical for understanding the infection process. We report a powerful and versatile approach to the selective labeling and identification of secreted pathogen proteins. Selective labeling of microbial proteins is accomplished via translational incorporation of azidonorleucine (Anl), a methionine surrogate that requires a mutant form of the methionyl-tRNA synthetase for activation. Secreted pathogen proteins containing Anl can be tagged by azide-alkyne cycloaddition and enriched by affinity purification. Application of the method to analysis of the type III secretion system of the human pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica enabled efficient identification of secreted proteins, identification of distinct secretion profiles for intracellular and extracellular bacteria, and determination of the order of substrate injection into host cells. This approach should be widely useful for the identification of virulence factors in microbial pathogens and the development of potential new targets for antimicrobial therapy.},

abstract = {How hydrophobicity (HY) drives protein folding is studied. The 1971 Nozaki-Tanford method of measuring HY is modified to use gases as solutes, not crystals, and this makes the method easy to use. Alkanes are found to be much more hydrophobic than rare gases, and the two different kinds of HY are termed intrinsic (rare gases) and extrinsic (alkanes). The HY values of rare gases are proportional to solvent-accessible surface area (ASA), whereas the HY values of alkanes depend on special hydration shells. Earlier work showed that hydration shells produce the hydration energetics of alkanes. Evidence is given here that the transfer energetics of alkanes to cyclohexane [Wolfenden R, Lewis CA, Jr, Yuan Y, Carter CW, Jr (2015) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112(24):7484-7488] measure the release of these shells. Alkane shells are stabilized importantly by van der Waals interactions between alkane carbon and water oxygen atoms. Thus, rare gases cannot form this type of shell. The very short (approximately picoseconds) lifetime of the van der Waals interaction probably explains why NMR efforts to detect alkane hydration shells have failed. The close similarity between the sizes of the opposing energetics for forming or releasing alkane shells confirms the presence of these shells on alkanes and supports Kauzmann's 1959 mechanism of protein folding. A space-filling model is given for the hydration shells on linear alkanes. The model reproduces the n values of Jorgensen et al. [Jorgensen WL, Gao J, Ravimohan C (1985) J Phys Chem 89:3470-3473] for the number of waters in alkane hydration shells.},

To tackle this issue, we created five-different lineages of coelenterazine (CTZ) analogues designed to selectively illuminate a specific luciferase with unique luciferase selectivity. In the attempt, we found that CTZ analogues with ethynyl or styryl groups display dramatically biased bioluminescence to specific luciferases and pHs by modifying the functional groups at the C-2 and C-6 positions of the imidazopyradinone backbone of CTZ. The optical contamination-free feature was exemplified with the luciferase-specific CTZ analogues, which illuminated anti-estrogenic and rapamycin activities in a mixture of optical probes. This unique bioluminescence platform has great potential for specific and high throughput imaging of multiple optical readouts in bioassays without optical contamination.},

Virtually all products precipitate, and with just a few different starting blocks every student, or pair of lab partners, can produce a unique "clicked" compound. Additionally, general procedures for in situ azide synthesis and phenol propargylation provide a vehicle for chemical discovery and creativity well beyond the mini-libraries presented.},

Therapeutic strategies that target tumor-associated sialosides may therefore potentiate antitumor immunity. Here, we report the development of antibody-sialidase conjugates that enhance tumor cell susceptibility to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) by selective desialylation of the tumor cell glycocalyx. We chemically fused a recombinant sialidase to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific antibody trastuzumab through a C-terminal aldehyde tag. The antibody-sialidase conjugate desialylated tumor cells in a HER2-dependent manner, reduced binding by natural killer (NK) cell inhibitory sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin (Siglec) receptors, and enhanced binding to the NK-activating receptor natural killer group 2D (NKG2D). Sialidase conjugation to trastuzumab enhanced ADCC against tumor cells expressing moderate levels of HER2, suggesting a therapeutic strategy for cancer patients with lower HER2 levels or inherent trastuzumab resistance. Precision glycocalyx editing with antibody-enzyme conjugates is therefore a promising avenue for cancer immune therapy.},

abstract = { Covering: up to July 2015 Nonribosomal peptides are amongst the most widespread and structurally diverse secondary metabolites in nature with many possessing bioactivity that can be exploited for therapeutic applications. Due to the major challenges associated with total- and semi-synthesis, bioengineering approaches have been developed to increase yields and generate modified peptides with improved physicochemical properties or altered bioactivity. Here we review the major advances that have been made over the last decade in engineering the biosynthesis of nonribosomal peptides. Structural diversity has been introduced by the modification of enzymes required for the supply of precursors or by heterologous expression of tailoring enzymes. The modularity of nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly lines further supports module or domain swapping methodologies to achieve changes in the amino acid sequence of nonribosomal peptides. We also review the new synthetic biology technologies promising to speed up the process, enabling the creation and optimisation of many more assembly lines for heterologous expression, offering new opportunities for engineering the biosynthesis of novel nonribosomal peptides.},

abstract = {We report here the preparation of ratiometric luminescent probes that contain two well-separated emission peaks produced by a sequential bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process. The probes are single soluble fusion proteins consisting of a thermostable firefly luciferase variant that catalyze yellow-green (560nm maximum) bioluminescence and a red fluorescent protein covalently labeled with a near-infrared fluorescent dye. The two proteins are connected by a decapeptide containing a protease recognition site specific for factor Xa, thrombin, or caspase 3. The rates of protease cleavage of the fusion protein substrates were monitored by recording emission spectra and plotting the change in peak ratios over time. Detection limits of 0.41nM for caspase 3, 1.0nM for thrombin, and 58nM for factor Xa were realized with a scanning fluorometer. Our results demonstrate for the first time that an efficient sequential BRET-FRET energy transfer process based on firefly luciferase bioluminescence can be employed to assay physiologically important protease activities.},

abstract = {Firefly luciferase produces light by converting substrate beetle luciferin into the corresponding adenylate that it subsequently oxidizes to oxyluciferin, the emitter of bioluminescence. We have confirmed the generally held notions that the oxidation step is initiated by formation of a carbanion intermediate and that a hydroperoxide (anion) is involved. Additionally, structural evidence is presented that accounts for the delivery of oxygen to the substrate reaction site. Herein, we report key convincing spectroscopic evidence of the participation of superoxide anion in a related chemical model reaction that supports a single electron-transfer pathway for the critical oxidative process. This mechanism may be a common feature of bioluminescence processes in which light is produced by an enzyme in the absence of cofactors.},

(2001) Science 293, 58-59 and Molema, G. {\&} Meijer, D. K. F., eds. (2001) Drug Targeting (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany)]. We describe a bipartite drug-delivery system that exploits (I) endogenous carbohydrate-to-lectin binding to localize glycosylated enzyme conjugates to specific, predetermined cell types followed by (II) administration of a prodrug activated by that predelivered enzyme at the desired site. The carbohydrate structure of an alpha-L-rhamnopyranosidase enzyme was specifically engineered through enzymatic deglycosylation and chemical reglycosylation. Combined in vivo and in vitro techniques (gamma scintigraphy, microautoradiography and confocal microscopy) determined organ and cellular localization and demonstrated successful activation of alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside prodrug. Ligand competition experiments revealed enhanced, specific localization by endocytosis and a strongly carbohydrate-dependent, 60-fold increase in selectivity toward target cell hepatocytes that generated a >30-fold increase (from 0.02 to 0.66 mg) in protein delivered. Furthermore, glycosylation engineering enhanced the serum-uptake rate and enzyme stability. This created enzyme activity (0.2 units in hepatocytes) for prodrug therapy, the target of which was switched simply by sugar-type alteration. The therapeutic effectiveness of lectin-directed enzyme-activated prodrug therapy was shown through the construction of the prodrug of doxorubicin, Rha-DOX, and its application to reduce tumor burden in a hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) disease model.},

abstract = {An 11-residue peptide with the sequence DSLEFIASKLA was identified from a genomic library of Bacillus subtilis by phage display as an efficient substrate for Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase-catalyzed protein labeling by small molecule-CoA conjugates. We name this peptide the "ybbR tag," because part of its sequence is derived from the ybbR ORF in the B. subtilis genome. The site of Sfp-catalyzed ybbR tag labeling was mapped to the underlined Ser residue, and the ybbR tag was found to have a strong tendency for adopting an alpha-helical conformation in solution. Here we demonstrate that the ybbR tag can be fused to the N or C termini of target proteins or inserted in a flexible loop in the middle of a target protein for site-specific protein labeling by Sfp. The short size of the ybbR tag and its compatibility with various target proteins, the broad substrate specificity of Sfp for labeling the ybbR tag with small-molecule probes of diverse structures, and the high specificity and efficiency of the labeling reaction make Sfp-catalyzed ybbR tag labeling an attractive tool for expanding protein structural and functional diversities by posttranslational modification.},

abstract = {Recent advances in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) have led to computational methods that can predict properties of photoexcited molecules with satisfactory accuracy at comparably moderate cost. We apply these methods to study the photophysics and photochemistry of 4-(dimethyl)aminobenzonitrile (DMABN). DMABN is considered the paradigm of photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), leading to dual fluorescence in polar solvents. By comparison of calculated emission energies, dipole moments, and vibrational frequencies with recent results from transient spectroscopy measurements, a definitive assignment of the electronic and geometric structure of the two lowest singlet excited states of DMABN is possible for the first time. We investigate the mechanism of the ICT reaction by means of minimum energy path calculations. The results confirm existing state-crossing models of dual fluorescence. Our study suggests that analytical TDDFT derivative methods will be useful to predict and classify emissive properties of other donor-acceptor systems as well.},

abstract = {Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) detects light generated by luciferase-mediated oxidation of substrate and is used widely for evaluating transgene expression in cell-based assays and in vivo in relevant preclinical models. The most commonly used luciferase for in vivo applications is firefly luciferase (fLuc), for which D-luciferin serves as the substrate. We demonstrated previously that the expression of the ABCG2 efflux transporter can significantly reduce BLI signal output and that HhAntag-691 can inhibit the efflux of D-luciferin, thereby enhancing BLI signal. Here we show that an HhAntag-691-sensitive uptake mechanism facilitates the intracellular concentration of D-luciferin and that the BLI dynamics of different cell lines are coregulated by this uptake mechanism in conjunction with ABCG2-mediated efflux. After administration of D-luciferin, the HhAntag-691-sensitive uptake mechanism generates a rapid increase in BLI signal that decreases over time, whereas ABCG2-mediated efflux stably reduces signal output. We implicate SLC22A4 (OCTN1), a member of the organic cation/zwitterion uptake transporter family, as one potential mediator of the HhAntag-691-sensitive D-luciferin uptake. These findings provide insight into mechanisms that contribute to the cellular uptake kinetics and in vivo biodistribution of D-luciferin.},

We hypothesized that the firefly luciferase substrate d-luciferin and its analogs are fatty acid mimics that are ideally suited to probe the chemistry of enzymes that release fatty acid products. Here, we synthesized luciferin amides and found that these molecules are hydrolyzed to substrates for firefly luciferase by the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). In the presence of luciferase, these molecules enable highly sensitive and selective bioluminescent detection of FAAH activity in vitro, in live cells, and in vivo. The potency and tissue distribution of FAAH inhibitors can be imaged in live mice, and luciferin amides serve as exemplary reagents for greatly improved bioluminescence imaging in FAAH-expressing tissues such as the brain.},

abstract = {Magnesium has important structural, catalytic and signaling roles in cells, yet few tools exist to image this metal ion in real time and at subcellular resolution. Here we report the first genetically encoded sensor for Mg2+, MagFRET-1. This sensor is based on the high-affinity Mg2+ binding domain of human centrin 3 (HsCen3), which undergoes a transition from a molten-globular apo form to a compactly-folded Mg2+-bound state. Fusion of Cerulean and Citrine fluorescent domains to the ends of HsCen3, yielded MagFRET-1, which combines a physiologically relevant Mg2+ affinity (Kd = 148 {\textmu}M) with a 50% increase in emission ratio upon Mg2+ binding due to a change in FRET efficiency between Cerulean and Citrine. Mutations in the metal binding sites yielded MagFRET variants whose Mg2+ affinities were attenuated 2- to 100-fold relative to MagFRET-1, thus covering a broad range of Mg2+ concentrations. In situ experiments in HEK293 cells showed that MagFRET-1 can be targeted to the cytosol and the nucleus. Clear responses to changes in extracellular Mg2+ concentration were observed for MagFRET-1-expressing HEK293 cells when they were permeabilized with digitonin, whereas similar changes were not observed for intact cells. Although MagFRET-1 is also sensitive to Ca2+, this affinity is sufficiently attenuated (Kd of 10 {\textmu}M) to make the sensor insensitive to known Ca2+ stimuli in HEK293 cells. While the potential and limitations of the MagFRET sensors for intracellular Mg2+ imaging need to be further established, we expect that these genetically encoded and ratiometric fluorescent Mg2+ sensors could prove very useful in understanding intracellular Mg2+ homeostasis and signaling.},

abstract = {Beetle luciferases produce different bioluminescence colors from green to red using the same d-luciferin substrate. Despite many studies of the mechanisms and structural determinants of bioluminescence colors with firefly luciferases, the identity of the emitters and the specific active site interactions responsible for bioluminescence color modulation remain elusive. To address these questions, we analyzed the bioluminescence spectra with 6'-amino-D-luciferin (aminoluciferin) and its 5,5-dimethyl analogue using a set of recombinant beetle luciferases that naturally elicit different colors and different pH sensitivities (pH-sensitive, Amydetes vivianii $\lambda$max=538 nm, Macrolampis sp2 $\lambda$max=564 nm; pH-insensitive, Phrixotrix hirtus $\lambda$max=623 nm, Phrixotrix vivianii $\lambda$max=546 nm, and Pyrearinus termitilluminans $\lambda$max=534 nm), a luciferase-like enzyme (Tenebrionidae, Zophobas morio $\lambda$max=613 nm), and mutants of C311 (S314). The green-yellow-emitting luciferases display red-shifted bioluminescence spectra with aminoluciferin in relation to those with D-luciferin, whereas the red-emitting luciferases displayed blue-shifted spectra. Bioluminescence spectra with 5,5-dimethylaminoluciferin, in which enolization is blocked, were almost identical to those of aminoluciferin. Fluorescence probing using 2-(4-toluidino)naphthalene-6-sulfonate and inference with aminoluciferin confirm that the luciferin binding site of the red-shifted luciferases is more polar than in the case of the green-yellow-emitting luciferases. Altogether, the results show that the keto form of excited oxyluciferin is the emitter in beetle bioluminescence and that bioluminescence colors are essentially modulated by interactions of the 6'-hydroxy group of oxyluciferin and basic moieties under the influence of the microenvironment polarity of the active site: a strong interaction between a base moiety and oxyluciferin phenol in a hydrophobic microenvironment promotes green-yellow emission, whereas a more polar environment weakens such interaction promoting red shifts. In pH-sensitive luciferases, a pH-mediated switch from a closed hydrophobic conformation to a more open polar conformation promotes the typical red shift.},

abstract = {The conventional analysis of enzyme evolution is to regard one single salient feature as a measure of fitness, expressed in a milieu exposing the possible selective advantage at a given time and location. Given that a single protein may serve more than one function, fitness should be assessed in several dimensions. In the present study we have explored individual mutational steps leading to a triple-point-mutated human GST (glutathione transferase) A2-2 displaying enhanced activity with azathioprine. A total of eight alternative substrates were used to monitor the diverse evolutionary trajectories. The epistatic effects of the mutations on catalytic activity were variable in sign and magnitude and depended on the substrate used, showing that epistasis is a multidimensional quality. Evidently, the multidimensional fitness landscape can lead to alternative trajectories resulting in enzymes optimized for features other than the selectable markers relevant at the origin of the evolutionary process. In this manner the evolutionary response is robust and can adapt to changing environmental conditions.

The influence of geometric conformations, solvent polarity, protonation state, and the covalent character of the O{\textendash}H bond of the hydroxyphenyl moiety were carefully studied. Striking differences in geometries and electronic structures among the states responsible for light emission were characterized. All fluorescence states can be described as a limited charge transfer process for a planar amide moiety. However, the chemiluminescence state is characterized by a much larger charge transfer that takes place over a longer distance. Moreover, the chemiluminescent coelenteramide structure exhibits an amide moiety that is no longer planar, in agreement with recent, more accurate ab initio results [Roca-Sanju{\'a}n et al. J. Chem.

Since thiocillin is derived from a genetically encoded peptide scaffold, site-directed mutagenesis allows for rapid generation of analogues. To understand thiocillin{\textquoteright}s structure{\textendash}activity relationship, we generated a site-saturation mutagenesis library covering each position along thiocillin{\textquoteright}s macrocyclic ring.

abstract = {PURPOSE:Firefly luciferase catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of D: -luciferin to oxyluciferin in the presence of cofactors, producing bioluminescence. This reaction is used in optical bioluminescence-based molecular imaging approaches to detect the expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. Biokinetics and distribution of the substrate most likely have a significant impact on levels of light signal and therefore need to be investigated.

METHODS:Benzene ring (14)C(U)-labeled D-luciferin was utilized. Cell uptake and efflux assays, murine biodistribution, autoradiography and CCD-camera based optical bioluminescence imaging were carried out to examine the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of the tracer in cell culture and in living mice respectively.

RESULTS:Radiolabeled and unlabeled D-luciferin revealed comparable levels of light emission when incubated with equivalent amounts of the firefly luciferase enzyme. Cell uptake assays in pCMV-luciferase-transfected cells showed slow trapping of the tracer and relatively low uptake values (up to 22.9-fold higher in firefly luciferase gene-transfected vs. nontransfected cells, p = 0.0002). Biodistribution studies in living mice after tail-vein injection of (14)C-D-luciferin demonstrated inhomogeneous tracer distribution with early predominant high radioactivity levels in kidneys (10.6% injected dose [ID]/g) and liver (11.9% ID/g), followed at later time points by the bladder (up to 81.3% ID/g) and small intestine (6.5% ID/g), reflecting the elimination routes of the tracer. Kinetics and uptake levels profoundly differed when using alternate injection routes (intravenous versus intraperitoneal). No clear trapping of (14)C-D-luciferin in firefly luciferase-expressing tissues could be observed in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS:The data obtained with (14)C-D-luciferin provide insights into the dynamics of D: -luciferin cell uptake, intracellular accumulation, and efflux. Results of the biodistribution and autoradiographic studies should be useful for optimizing and adapting optical imaging protocols to specific experimental settings when utilizing the firefly luciferase and D: -luciferin system.},

abstract = {Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have shown great promise for the immunological treatment of cancer. Nevertheless, the need to genetically engineer a patient's T-cells has presented significant production and safety challenges. To address these issues, we have demonstrated that chemically self-assembled nanorings (CSANs) displaying single chain antibodies can bind to both the CD3 $\varepsilon$ subunit of the T-cell-receptor/CD3 complex and the CD22 antigen on malignant B cells such as B-leukemias or lymphomas. We demonstrate that the multivalent and bispecific format allows the antiCD3/antiCD22 CSANs to stably bind to T-cell surfaces for greater than 4 days, while being easily disassembled on the cell membrane by treatment with the nontoxic FDA approved drug, trimethoprim. In the presence of CD22+ Raji cells, T-cells modified with antiCD3/antiCD22 CSANs were shown to selectively up-regulate the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$) and to initiate cytotoxicity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that antiCD3/antiCD22 bispecific CSANs offer a potential alternative to CARs, as prosthetic antigen receptors.},

abstract = {Regulation of an intracellular acidic environment plays a pivotal role in biological processes and functions. However, spatiotemporal analysis of the acidification in complex tissues of living subjects persists as an important challenge. We developed a photo-inactivatable bioluminescent indicator, based on a combination of luciferase-fragment complementation and a photoreaction of a light, oxygen, and voltage domain from Avena sativa Phototropin1 (LOV2), to visualize temporally dynamic acidification in living tissue samples. Bioluminescence of the indicator diminished upon light irradiation and it recovered gradually in the dark state thereafter. The recovery rate was remarkably sensitive to pH changes but unsusceptible to fluctuation of luciferin or ATP concentrations. Bioluminescence imaging, taken as an index of the recovery rates, enabled long-time recording of acidification in apoptotic and autophagous processes in a cell population and an ischemic condition in living mice. This technology using the indicator is widely applicable to sense organelle-specific acidic changes in target biological tissues.},

This method was used to ligate a phosphotyrosine peptide to the C terminus of the protein tyrosine kinase C-terminal Src kinase (Csk). By intercepting a thioester generated in the recombinant protein with an N-terminal cysteine containing synthetic peptide, near quantitative chemical ligation of the peptide to the protein was achieved. The semisynthetic tail-phosphorylated Csk showed evidence of an intramolecular phosphotyrosine-Src homology 2 interaction and an unexpected increase in catalytic phosphoryl transfer efficiency toward a physiologically relevant substrate compared with the non-tail-phosphorylated control. This work illustrates that expressed protein ligation is a simple and powerful new method in protein engineering to introduce sequences of unnatural amino acids, posttranslational modifications, and biophysical probes into proteins of any size.},

First, we conjugated a far-red fluorescent indocyanine derivative to biotinylated Cypridina luciferase. This conjugate produced a bimodal spectrum that has long-wavelength bioluminescence emission in the far-red region as a result of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer. To generate a far-red luminescent probe with targeting and imaging capabilities of tumors, we then linked this conjugate to an anti-human Dlk-1 monoclonal antibody via the biotin-avidin interaction. This far-red luminescent probe enabled us to obtain high-resolution microscopic images of live, Dlk-1-expressing Huh-7 cells without an external light source, and to monitor the accumulation of this probe in tumor-bearing mice. Thus this far-red luminescent probe is a convenient analytical tool for the evaluations of monoclonal antibody localization in a living body.},

During photoirradiation, reaction mixtures are continuously pumped through a column of a AgNO3-impregnated silica gel. The trans-cyclooctene derivative is selectively retained by the AgNO3-impregnated silica, but the cis-isomer elutes from the column back to the reaction flask, where it is photoisomerized and recirculated through the column. The method provides access to a range of usefully functionalized derivatives of trans-cyclooctene, including a derivative of 5-aza-trans-cyclooctene that underwent transannular cyclization upon treatment with bromine. The alkene stereochemistry is transferred with high fidelity to the hexahydropyrrolizine framework in the transannular cyclization.},

Histone PTMs work in concert with this network to regulate gene transcription through the histone code, and the dysregulation of PTM maintenance is linked to a large number of diseases, including many types of cancer. A wealth of research aims to elucidate the functions of this code, but our understanding of the effects of PTMs, specifically the methylation of lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg), is lacking. The development of new tools to study PTMs relies on a sophisticated understanding of the mechanisms that drive protein and small molecule recognition in water. In this review, we outline the physical organic concepts that drive the molecular recognition of Lys and Arg methylation by reader proteins and draw comparisons to the binding mechanisms of small molecule receptors for methylated Lys and Arg that have been developed recently.},

abstract = {Many therapeutic leads fail to advance clinically because of bioavailability, selectivity, and formulation problems. Molecular transporters can be used to address these problems. Molecular transporter conjugates of otherwise poorly soluble or poorly bioavailable drugs or probes exhibit excellent solubility in water and biological fluids and at the same time an enhanced ability to enter tissues and cells and with modification to do so selectively. For many conjugates, however, it is necessary to release the drug/probe cargo from the transporter after uptake to achieve activity. Here, we describe an imaging method that provides quantification of transporter conjugate uptake and cargo release in real-time in animal models. This method uses transgenic (luciferase) reporter mice and whole-body imaging, allowing noninvasive quantification of transporter conjugate uptake and probe (luciferin) release in real time. This process effectively emulates drug-conjugate delivery, drug release, and drug turnover by an intracellular target, providing a facile method to evaluate comparative uptake of new transporters and efficacy and selectivity of linker release as required for fundamental studies and therapeutic applications.},

abstract = {Artificial transcription factors (ATFs) are precision-tailored molecules designed to bind DNA and regulate transcription in a preprogrammed manner. Libraries of ATFs enable the high-throughput screening of gene networks that trigger cell fate decisions or phenotypic changes. We developed a genome-scale library of ATFs that display an engineered interaction domain (ID) to enable cooperative assembly and synergistic gene expression at targeted sites. We used this ATF library to screen for key regulators of the pluripotency network and discovered three combinations of ATFs capable of inducing pluripotency without exogenous expression of Oct4 (POU domain, class 5, TF 1). Cognate site identification, global transcriptional profiling, and identification of ATF binding sites reveal that the ATFs do not directly target Oct4; instead, they target distinct nodes that converge to stimulate the endogenous pluripotency network. This forward genetic approach enables cell type conversions without a priori knowledge of potential key regulators and reveals unanticipated gene network dynamics that drive cell fate choices.},

abstract = {Imaging reporter gene expression in living subjects is a rapidly evolving area of molecular imaging research. Studies have validated the use of reporter genes with positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), MRI, fluorescence with wild-type and mutants of green fluorescent protein, as well as bioluminescence using Firefly luciferase enzyme/protein (FL). In the current study, we validate for the first time the ability to image bioluminescence from Renilla luciferase enzyme/protein (RL) by injecting the substrate coelenterazine in living mice. A highly sensitive cooled charge-coupled device camera provides images within a few minutes of photon counting. Cells, transiently expressing the Rluc were imaged while located in the peritoneum, s.c. layer, as well as in the liver and lungs of living mice tail-vein injected with coelenterazine. Furthermore, d-luciferin (a substrate for FL) does not serve as a substrate for RL, and coelenterazine does not serve as a substrate for FL either in cell culture or in living mice. We also show that both Rluc and Fluc expression can be imaged in the same living mouse and that the kinetics of light production are distinct. The approaches validated will have direct applications to various studies where two molecular events need to be tracked, including cell trafficking of two cell populations, two gene therapy vectors, and indirect monitoring of two endogenous genes through the use of two reporter genes.},

abstract = {Firefly luciferase catalyzes the highly efficient emission of yellow-green light from substrate luciferin by a sequence of reactions that require Mg-ATP and molecular oxygen. We previously reported [Branchini, B. R., Magyar, R. A., Marcantonio, K. M., Newberry, K. J., Stroh, J. G., Hinz, L. K., and Murtiashaw, M. H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 19359-19364] that 2-(4-benzoylphenyl)thiazole-4-carboxylic acid (BPTC), a firefly luciferin analogue, was a potent photoinactivation reagent for luciferase. We identified a luciferase peptide 244HHGF247, the degradation of which was directly correlated to the photooxidation process. We report here the construction and purification of wild-type and mutant luciferases H244F, H245F, H245A, and H245D. The results of photoinactivation and kinetic and bioluminescence studies with these proteins are consistent with His245 being the primary functional target of BPTC-catalyzed enzyme inactivation. The possibility that His245 is oxidized to aspartate during the photooxidation reaction was supported by the extremely low specific activity ( approximately 300-fold lower than WT) of the H245D mutant. Using the crystal structures of luciferase without substrates [Conti, E., Franks, N. P., and Brick, P. (1996) Structure 4, 287-298] and the functionally related phenylalanine-activating subunit of gramicidin synthetase 1 [Conti, E., Stachelhaus, T., Marahiel, M. A., and Brick, P. (1997) EMBO J. 16, 4174-4183] as a starting point, we have performed molecular-modeling studies and propose here a model for the luciferase active site with substrates luciferin and Mg-ATP bound. We have used this model to provide a structure-based interpretation of the role of 244HHGF247 in firefly bioluminescence.},

abstract = {Recent advances in the field of programmable DNA-binding proteins have led to the development of facile methods for genomic localization of genetically encodable entities. Despite the extensive utility of these tools, locus-specific delivery of synthetic molecules remains limited by a lack of adequate technologies. Here we combine the flexibility of chemical synthesis with the specificity of a programmable DNA-binding protein by using protein trans-splicing to ligate synthetic elements to a nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) in vitro and subsequently deliver the dCas9 cargo to live cells. The versatility of this technology is demonstrated by delivering dCas9 fusions that include either the small-molecule bromodomain and extra-terminal family bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 or a peptide-based PRC1 chromodomain ligand, which are capable of recruiting endogenous copies of their cognate binding partners to targeted genomic binding sites. We expect that this technology will allow for the genomic localization of a wide array of small molecules and modified proteinaceous materials.},

The sensor 1 showed characteristic dual fluorescence and it was shown that the guanidinium group in the proximity of the DMAB group influenced largely the TICT formation process in 1. Liquid/liquid extraction experiments demonstrated that the intensity ratio of the TICT fluorescence to the locally-excited (LE) fluorescence (ITICT/ILE) observed from the organic layer decreased with an increase in the concentration of N-acetyl-D-phenylalanine (AcPhe) in the water phase. Such fluorescence titration experiments afforded the apparent binding constant between 1 and AcPhe to be 7.0 {\texttimes} 105 M{\textminus}1. Temperature dependence of the fluorescence spectrum of 1 in the absence and presence of AcPhe indicated that the primary origin of the change in the ITICT/ILE value upon recognition of the amino acid was the increase in the activation energy of the TICT formation process in 1.},

abstract = {Enzyme regulation proteins are very important due to their involvement in many biological processes that sustain life. The complexity of these proteins, the impossibility of identifying direct quantification molecular properties associated with the regulation of enzymatic activities, and their structural diversity creates the necessity for new theoretical methods that can predict the enzyme regulatory function of new proteins. The current work presents the first classification model that predicts protein enzyme regulators using the Markov mean properties. These protein descriptors encode the topological information of the amino acid into contact networks based on amino acid distances and physicochemical properties. MInD-Prot software calculated these molecular descriptors for 2415 protein chains (350 enzyme regulators) using five atom physicochemical properties (Mulliken electronegativity, Kang-Jhon polarizability, vdW area, atom contribution to P) and the protein 3D regions. The best classification models to predict enzyme regulators have been obtained with machine learning algorithms from Weka using 18 features. K* has been demonstrated to be the most accurate algorithm for this protein function classification. Wrapper Subset Evaluator and SVM-RFE approaches were used to perform a feature subset selection with the best results obtained from SVM-RFE. Classification performance employing all the available features can be reached using only the 8 most relevant features selected by SVM-RFE. Thus, the current work has demonstrated the possibility of predicting new molecular targets involved in enzyme regulation using fast theoretical algorithms.},

abstract = {How transcription factor dimerization impacts DNA-binding specificity is poorly understood. Guided by protein dimerization properties, we examined DNA binding specificities of 270 human bZIP pairs. DNA interactomes of 80 heterodimers and 22 homodimers revealed that 72% of heterodimer motifs correspond to conjoined half-sites preferred by partnering monomers. Remarkably, the remaining motifs are composed of variably-spaced half-sites (12%) or 'emergent' sites (16%) that cannot be readily inferred from half-site preferences of partnering monomers. These binding sites were biochemically validated by EMSA-FRET analysis and validated in vivo by ChIP-seq data from human cell lines. Focusing on ATF3, we observed distinct cognate site preferences conferred by different bZIP partners, and demonstrated that genome-wide binding of ATF3 is best explained by considering many dimers in which it participates. Importantly, our compendium of bZIP-DNA interactomes predicted bZIP binding to 156 disease associated SNPs, of which only 20 were previously annotated with known bZIP motifs.},
