T1  - Eco-Evo Bioluminescence on Land and in the Sea.
N2  - This review discusses the evolution of bioluminescence organisms that inhabit various environments based on the current understanding of their unique ecologies and biochemistries.  As shown here, however, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the functions and mechanisms of bioluminescence, which should be investigated in further studies.  To facilitate future research in this field, we introduce our recent attempt, the bioluminescent organism DNA barcode initiative.  This genetic ref. library will provide resources for other scientists to efficiently identify unstudied bioluminescent organisms, focus their biochem. and genetic research goals, and will generally promote bioluminescence as a field of scientific study.

T1  - Brominated Luciferins Are Versatile Bioluminescent Probes.
N2  - We report a set of brominated luciferins for bioluminescence imaging.  These regioisomeric scaffolds were accessed by using a common synthetic route.  All analogs produced light with firefly luciferase, although varying levels of emission were obsd.  Differences in photon output were analyzed by computation and photophys. measurements.  The brightest brominated luciferin was further evaluated in cell and animal models.  At low doses, the analog outperformed the native substrate in cells.  The remaining luciferins, although weak emitters with firefly luciferase, were inherently capable of light prodn. and thus potential substrates for orthogonal mutant enzymes. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - A luciferin analogue generating near-infrared bioluminescence achieves highly sensitive deep-tissue imaging.
N2  - In preclin. cancer research, bioluminescence imaging with firefly luciferase and  -luciferin has become a std. to monitor biol. processes both in vitro and in vivo.  However, the emission max. (λmax) of bioluminescence produced by  -luciferin is 562 nm where light is not highly penetrable in biol. tissues.  This emphasizes a need for developing a red-shifted bioluminescence imaging system to improve detection sensitivity of targets in deep tissue.  Here we characterize the bioluminescent properties of the newly synthesized luciferin analog, AkaLumine-HCl.  The bioluminescence produced by AkaLumine-HCl in reactions with native firefly luciferase is in the near-IR wavelength ranges (λmax=677 nm), and yields significantly increased target-detection sensitivity from deep tissues with maximal signals attained at very low concns., as compared with  -luciferin and emerging synthetic luciferin CycLuc1.  These characteristics offer a more sensitive and accurate method for non-invasive bioluminescence imaging with native firefly luciferase in various animal models. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Firefly Luciferase Mutants Allow Substrate-Selective Bioluminescence Imaging in the Mouse Brain.
N2  - Bioluminescence imaging is a powerful approach for visualizing specific events occurring inside live mice.  Animals can be made to glow in response to the expression of a gene, the activity of an enzyme, or the growth of a tumor.  But bioluminescence requires the interaction of a luciferase enzyme with a small-mol. luciferin, and its scope has been limited by the mere handful of natural combinations.  Herein, we show that mutants of firefly luciferase can discriminate between natural and synthetic substrates in the brains of live mice.  When using adeno-assocd. viral (AAV) vectors to express luciferases in the brain, we found that mutant luciferases that are inactive or weakly active with D-luciferin can light up brightly when treated with the aminoluciferins CycLuc1 and CycLuc2 or their resp. FAAH-sensitive luciferin amides.  Further development of selective luciferases promises to expand the power of bioluminescence and allow multiple events to be imaged in the same live animal.

T1  - Experimental support for a single electron-transfer oxidation mechanism in firefly bioluminescence.
N2  - Firefly luciferase produces light by converting firefly luciferin substrate into the corresponding adenylate that it subsequently oxidizes to oxyluciferin, the emitter of bioluminescence.  The authors confirmed the generally held notions that the oxidn. step is initiated by formation of a carbanion intermediate and that a hydroperoxide (anion) is involved.  Addnl., structural evidence is presented that accounts for the delivery of oxygen to the substrate reaction site.  Here, the authors report key convincing spectroscopic evidence of the participation of superoxide anion in a related chem. model reaction that supports a single electron-transfer pathway for the crit. oxidative process.  This mechanism may be a common feature of bioluminescence processes in which light is produced by an enzyme in the absence of cofactors. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Novel mechanism of bioluminescence: Oxidative decarboxylation of a moiety adjacent to the light emitter of Fridericia luciferin.
N2  - Fridericia luciferin (I), a novel luciferin from a bioluminescent Siberian earthworm, Fridericia heliota, was recently described.  Here, Fridericia oxyluciferin was produced from I by Fridericia luciferase and isolated and its structure elucidated.  The results provided insight into a novel bioluminescence mechanism found in Nature.  Oxidative decarboxylation of a Lys fragment of I supplied energy for light generation, while a fluorescent CompX moiety, a luciferin-related tyrosine deriv., remains intact and serves as the light emitter.  A chemiluminescent model compd. for I adenylate was also prepd. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Tools for visualizing cell-cell 'interactomes'.
N2  - A review.  Cellular communication drives diverse aspects of organismal biol. ranging from immune function to memory formation.  The mechanisms by which cells transact information in vivo, though, are not completely understood.  This is due, in part, to a lack of tools for observing collections of cells in their native habitats.  New optical probes are being crafted to image networks of cell-cell interactions (i.e., 'interactomes') in tissues and live organisms.  Examples of these probes - and their use in visualizing cell contacts and macroscopic cell networks - are highlighted. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Rapid and scalable assembly of firefly luciferase substrates.
N2  - Bioluminescence imaging with luciferase-luciferin pairs is a popular method for visualizing biol. processes in vivo.  Unfortunately, most luciferins are difficult to access and remain prohibitively expensive for some imaging applications.  Here we report cost-effective and efficient syntheses of D-luciferin and 6'-aminoluciferin, two widely used bioluminescent substrates.  Our approach employs inexpensive anilines and Appel's salt to generate the luciferin cores in a single pot.  Addnl., the syntheses are scalable and can provide multi-gram quantities of both substrates.  The streamlined prodn. and improved accessibility of luciferin reagents will bolster in vivo imaging efforts. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - A Dual-Color Far-Red to Near-Infrared Firefly Luciferin Analogue Designed for Multiparametric Bioluminescence Imaging.
N2  - Red-shifted bioluminescent emitters allow improved in vivo tissue penetration and signal quantification, and have led to the development of beetle luciferin analogs that elicit red-shifted bioluminescence with firefly luciferase (Fluc).  However, unlike natural luciferin, none have been shown to emit different colors with different luciferases.  We have synthesized and tested the first dual-color, far-red to near-IR (nIR) emitting analog of beetle luciferin, which, akin to natural luciferin, exhibits pH dependent fluorescence spectra and emits bioluminescence of different colors with different engineered Fluc enzymes.  Our analog produces different far-red to nIR emission maxima up to λmax=706 nm with different Fluc mutants.  This emission is the most red-shifted bioluminescence reported without using a resonance energy transfer acceptor.  This improvement should allow tissues to be more effectively probed using multiparametric deep-tissue bioluminescence imaging. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Codon compression algorithms for saturation mutagenesis.
N2  - Satn. mutagenesis is employed in protein engineering and genome-editing efforts to generate libraries that span amino acid design space.  Traditionally, this is accomplished by using degenerate/compressed codons such as NNK (N = A/C/G/T, K = G/T), which covers all amino acids and one stop codon.  These solns. suffer from two types of redundancy: (a) different codons for the same amino acid lead to bias, and (b) wild type amino acid is included within the library.  These redundancies increase library size and downstream screening efforts.  Here, we present a dynamic approach to compress codons for any desired list of amino acids, taking into account codon usage.  This results in a unique codon collection for every amino acid to be mutated, with the desired redundancy level.  Finally, we demonstrate that this approach can be used to design precise oligo libraries amendable to recombineering and CRISPR-based genome editing to obtain a diverse population with high efficiency.

T1  - Aminoluciferins Extend Firefly Luciferase Bioluminescence into the Near-Infrared and Can Be Preferred Substrates over D-Luciferin.
N2  - Firefly luciferase adenylates and oxidizes D-luciferin to chem. generate visible light and is widely used for biol. assays and imaging.  Here we show that both luciferase and luciferin can be reengineered to extend the scope of this light-emitting reaction.  D-Luciferin can be replaced by synthetic luciferin analogs that increase near-IR photon flux >10-fold over that of D-luciferin in live luciferase-expressing cells.  Firefly luciferase can be mutated to accept and utilize rigid aminoluciferins with high activity in both live and lysed cells yet exhibit 10 000-fold selectivity over the natural luciferase substrate.  These new luciferin analogs thus pave the way to an extended family of bioluminescent reporters. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Bioluminescence of beetle luciferases with 6'-amino-D-luciferin analogues reveals excited keto-oxyluciferin as the emitter and phenolate/luciferin binding site interactions modulate bioluminescence colors.
N2  - Beetle luciferases produce different bioluminescence colors from green to red using the same D-luciferin substrate.  Despite many studies of the mechanisms and structural determinants of bioluminescence colors with firefly luciferases, the identity of the emitters and the specific active site interactions responsible for bioluminescence color modulation remain elusive.  Here, to address these questions, the authors analyzed the bioluminescence spectra with 6'-amino-D-luciferin (aminoluciferin) and its 5,5-di-Me analog using a set of recombinant beetle luciferases that naturally elicited different colors and different pH sensitivities (pH-sensitive, Amydetes vivianii λmax = 538 nm; Macrolampis sp2 λmax = 564 nm; pH-insensitive, Phrixothrix hirtus λmax = 623 nm; Phrixothrix vivianii λmax = 546 nm; and Pyrearinus termitilluminans λmax = 534 nm), a luciferase-like enzyme (Tenebrionidae, Zophobas morio λmax = 613 nm), and mutants of C311 (S314).  The green-yellow-emitting luciferases displayed red-shifted bioluminescence spectra with aminoluciferin in relation to those with D-luciferin, whereas the red-emitting luciferases displayed blue-shifted spectra.  Bioluminescence spectra with 5,5-dimethylaminoluciferin, in which enolization was blocked, were almost identical to those of aminoluciferin.  Fluorescence probing using 2-(4-toluidino)naphthalene-6-sulfonate and inference with aminoluciferin confirmed that the luciferin-binding site of the red-shifted luciferases is more polar than in the case of the green-yellow-emitting luciferases.  Altogether, the results showed that the keto form of excited oxyluciferin is the emitter in beetle bioluminescence and that bioluminescence colors are essentially modulated by interactions of the 6'-OH group of oxyluciferin and basic moieties under the influence of the microenvironment polarity of the active site: a strong interaction between a base moiety and oxyluciferin phenol in a hydrophobic microenvironment promotes green-yellow emission, whereas a more polar environment weakens such interaction promoting red shifts.  In pH-sensitive luciferases, a pH-mediated switch from a closed hydrophobic conformation to a more open polar conformation promotes the typical red shift. [on SciFinder(R)]

N2  - A review.  Bioluminescence is a ubiquitous imaging modality for visualizing biol. processes in vivo.  This technique employs visible light and interfaces readily with most cell and tissue types, making it a versatile technol. for preclin. studies.  Here we review basic bioluminescence imaging principles, along with applications of the technol. that are relevant to the medicinal chem. community.  These include noninvasive cell tracking expts., analyses of protein function, and methods to visualize small mol. metabolites.  In each section, we also discuss how bioluminescent tools have revealed insights into exptl. therapies and aided drug discovery.  Last, we highlight the development of new bioluminescent tools that will enable more sensitive and multi-component imaging expts. and, thus, expand our broader understanding of living systems.

T1  - A synthetic luciferin improves bioluminescence imaging in live mice.
N2  - Firefly luciferase is the most widely used optical reporter for noninvasive bioluminescence imaging (BLI) in rodents.  BLI relies on the ability of the injected luciferase substrate D-luciferin to access luciferase-expressing cells and tissues within the animal.  Here we show that injection of mice with a synthetic luciferin, CycLuc1, improves BLI with existing luciferase reporters and enables imaging in the brain that could not be achieved with D-luciferin.

T1  - Triple bioluminescence imaging for in vivo monitoring of cellular processes.
N2  - Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) has shown to be crucial for monitoring in vivo biol. processes.  So far, only dual bioluminescence imaging using firefly (Fluc) and Renilla or Gaussia (Gluc) luciferase has been achieved due to the lack of availability of other efficiently expressed luciferases using different substrates.  Here, we characterized a codon-optimized luciferase from Vargula hilgendorfii (Vluc) as a reporter for mammalian gene expression.  We showed that Vluc can be multiplexed with Gluc and Fluc for sequential imaging of three distinct cellular phenomena in the same biol. system using vargulin, coelenterazine, and -luciferin substrates, resp.  We applied this triple imaging system to monitor the effect of sol. tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL) delivered using an adeno-assocd. viral vector (AAV) on brain tumors in mice.  Vluc imaging showed efficient sTRAIL gene delivery to the brain, while Fluc imaging revealed a robust antiglioma therapy.  Further, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation in response to sTRAIL binding to glioma cells death receptors was monitored by Gluc imaging.  This work is the first demonstration of trimodal in vivo bioluminescence imaging and will have a broad applicability in many different fields including immunol., oncol., virol., and neuroscience.

T1  - Rational Design and Development of Near-Infrared-Emitting Firefly Luciferins Available In Vivo.
N2  - Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based near-IR (NIR)-emitting luciferins were developed by utilizing a new design strategy based on the results of docking simulation and studies of structure-luminescence intensity relationships.  As far as the authors know, this is the first report of NIR bioluminescence obtained in living cells and living animals without the need for the manipulation of luciferase.  The compds. synthesized had the ability to provide NIR bioluminescence signals from deep tissues.  However, the luminescence from these substrates was rather weak (∼0.6-4% of the of aminoluciferin in vitro and ∼0.1-0.1% in cells), probably because of their restricted intracellular delivery, as well as their relatively weak luminescence in vitro.

T1  - The luciferin binding site residues C/T311 (S314) influence the bioluminescence color of beetle luciferases through main-chain interaction with oxyluciferin phenolate.
N2  - Beetle luciferases emit different bioluminescence colors from green to red; however, no clear relation between the identity of the luciferin binding site residues and bioluminescence colors has been found in different luciferases, and it is unclear whether crit. interactions affecting emission spectra occur on the thiazolyl or on the benzothiazolyl sides of the luciferin-binding site.  Here, through homol. modeling and site-directed mutagenesis using a multicolor set of beetle luciferases (Pyrearinus termitilluminans larval click beetle, Pte, λmax = 534 nm; Phrixothrix hirtus railroad worm red emitting, PxRE, λmax = 623 nm; and Macrolampis sp2 firefly, Mac, λmax = 564 nm), the authors show that residues Cys-311/Thr-311 (Ser-314) play an important role in bioluminescence color detn.  Modeling studies indicated that the main-chain carbonyls of these residues were close to both oxyluciferin phenolate and AMP, whereas the side-chains packed against 2nd-shell residues.  The C311(S314)A mutation considerably red-shifted the spectra of the green-yellow-emitting luciferases (Pte λmax = 534 to 590 nm; Mac λmax = 564 to 583/613 nm) and affected the Km values for luciferin and ATP, but not the spectrum of the red-emitting luciferase.  On the other hand, whereas the exchange between Cys-311/Thr-311 (Ser-314) caused smaller effects on the emission spectra of green-yellow-emitting luciferases, the C311T substitution (naturally found in green-emitting railroad worm luciferases) resulted in the largest reported blue shift in P. hirtus red-emitting luciferase (λmax = 623 to 606 nm).  Altogether, these results indicate that the stability of residues Cys-311/Thr-311 (Ser-314) and the size of the cavity around oxyluciferin phenolate affect bioluminescence colors and suggest, for the 1st time, the occurrence of a crit. interaction between main-chain carbonyls of position 311 (314) residues and oxyluciferin phenolate.

T1  - Novel Heterocyclic Analogues of Firefly Luciferin.
N2  - Five novel firefly luciferin analogs in which the benzothiazole ring system of the natural substrate was replaced with benzimidazole, benzofuran, benzothiophene, benzoxazole, and indole were synthesized.  The fluorescence, bioluminescence, and kinetic properties of the compds. were evaluated with recombinant Photinus pyralis wild type luciferase.  With the exception of indole, all of the substrates contg. heterocycle substitutions produced readily measurable flashes of light with luciferase.  Compared to that of luciferin, the intensities ranged from 0.3 to 4.4% in reactions with varying pH optima and times to reach maximal intensity.  The heteroatom changes influenced both the fluorescence and bioluminescence emission spectra, which displayed maxima of 479-528 and 518-574 nm, resp.  While there were some interesting trends in the spectroscopic and bioluminescence properties of this group of structurally similar substrate analogs, the most significant findings were assocd. with the benzothiophene-contg. compd.  This synthetic substrate produced slow decay glow kinetics that increased the total light-based specific activity of luciferase more than 4-fold vs. the luciferin value.  Moreover, over the pH range of 6.2-9.4, the emission max. is 523 nm, an unusual 37 nm blue shift compared to that of the natural substrate.  The extraordinary bioluminescence properties of the benzothiophene luciferin should translate into greater sensitivity for analyte detection in a wide variety of luciferase-based applications.

T1  - Engineered Luciferase Reporter from a Deep Sea Shrimp Utilizing a Novel Imidazopyrazinone Substrate.
N2  - Bioluminescence methodologies have been extraordinarily useful due to their high sensitivity, broad dynamic range, and operational simplicity.  These capabilities have been realized largely through incremental adaptations of native enzymes and substrates, originating from luminous organisms of diverse evolutionary lineages.  We engineered both an enzyme and substrate in combination to create a novel bioluminescence system capable of more efficient light emission with superior biochem. and phys. characteristics.  Using a small luciferase subunit (19 kDa) from the deep sea shrimp Oplophorus gracilirostris, we have improved luminescence expression in mammalian cells ∼2.5 million-fold by merging optimization of protein structure with development of a novel imidazopyrazinone substrate (furimazine).  The new luciferase, NanoLuc, produces glow-type luminescence (signal half-life >2 h) with a specific activity ∼150-fold greater than that of either firefly (Photinus pyralis) or Renilla luciferases similarly configured for glow-type assays.  In mammalian cells, NanoLuc shows no evidence of post-translational modifications or subcellular partitioning.  The enzyme exhibits high phys. stability, retaining activity with incubation up to 55 °C or in culture medium for >15 h at 37 °C.  As a genetic reporter, NanoLuc may be configured for high sensitivity or for response dynamics by appending a degrdn. sequence to reduce intracellular accumulation.  Appending a signal sequence allows NanoLuc to be exported to the culture medium, where reporter expression can be measured without cell lysis.  Fusion onto other proteins allows luminescent assays of their metab. or localization within cells.  Reporter quantitation is achievable even at very low expression levels to facilitate more reliable coupling with endogenous cellular processes. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Crystal Structure of Firefly Luciferase in a Second Catalytic Conformation Supports a Domain Alternation Mechanism.
N2  - Beetle luciferases catalyze a two-step reaction that includes the initial adenylation of the luciferin substrate, followed by an oxidative decarboxylation that ultimately produces light.  Evidence for homologous acyl-CoA synthetases supports a domain alternation catalytic mechanism in which these enzymes' C-terminal domain rotates by ∼140° to adopt two conformations that are used to catalyze the two partial reactions.  While many structures exist for acyl-CoA synthetases in both conformations, to date only biochem. evidence supports domain alternation with luciferase.  We have detd. the structure of a cross-linked luciferase enzyme that is trapped in the second conformation.  This new structure supports the role of the second catalytic conformation and provides insights into the biochem. mechanism of the luciferase oxidative step. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Reducing codon redundancy and screening effort of combinatorial protein libraries created by saturation mutagenesis.
N2  - Satn. mutagenesis probes define sections of the vast protein sequence space.  However, even if randomization is limited this way, the combinatorial nos. problem is severe.  Because diversity is created at the codon level, codon redundancy is a crucial factor detg. the necessary effort for library screening.  Addnl., due to the probabilistic nature of the sampling process, oversampling is required to ensure library completeness as well as a high probability to encounter all unique variants.  Our trick employs a special mixt. of three primers, creating a degeneracy of 22 unique codons coding for the 20 canonical amino acids.  Therefore, codon redundancy and subsequent screening effort is significantly reduced, and a balanced distribution of codon per amino acid is achieved, as demonstrated exemplarily for a library of cyclohexanone monooxygenase.  We show that this strategy is suitable for any satn. mutagenesis methodol. to generate less-redundant libraries. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Firefly Chemiluminescence and Bioluminescence: Efficient Generation of Excited States.
N2  - A review.  Firefly luciferase catalyzes a light-emitting reaction in which an excited-state product is formed.  Both exptl. and theor. methodologies are used to study this system, and the reactions catalyzed by luciferase are relatively well characterized.  However, the mechanism by which an excited-state product is formed is still unknown.  This Minireview deals with the current understanding of firefly bioluminescence and chemiluminescence.  Thermal decompn. of simple 1,2-dioxetanes is also discussed, due to their role in formation of the excited-state bioluminophore. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Expedient Synthesis of Electronically Modified Luciferins for Bioluminescence Imaging.
N2  - Bioluminescence imaging with luciferase enzymes requires access to light-emitting, small-mol. luciferins.  Here, the authors describe a rapid method to synthesize D-luciferin, the substrate for firefly luciferase (Fluc), along with a novel set of electronically modified analogs.  The authors' procedure uses a relatively rare, but synthetically useful dithiazolium reagent to generate heteroarom. scaffolds in a divergent fashion.  Two of the luciferin analogs produced with this approach emit light with Fluc in vitro and in live cells.  Collectively, the authors' work increases the no. of substrates that can be used for bioluminescence imaging and provides a general strategy for synthesizing new collections of luciferins.

T1  - Comparison of random mutagenesis and semi-rational designed libraries for improved cytochrome P450 BM3-catalyzed hydroxylation of small alkanes.
N2  - Three semi-rational approaches, combinatorial site-satn. mutagenesis (CSSM) using a reduced amino acid set and two libraries based on Corbit and CRAM computational design algorithms targeting up to 10 active site residues, were used to engineer cytochrome P 450 BM3 to demethylate di-Me ether and hydroxylate propane and ethane.  These small libraries (343-1028 variants) were all enriched with respect to the fraction functional and maximal activities compared with a random mutagenesis library and individual site-satn. libraries targeting the same residues.  Despite high av. amino acid substitution levels of 2.6, 5 and 7.5, the CSSM, Corbit and CRAM libraries had at least 75% of library members properly folded.  Propane- and ethane-hydroxylating P 450 BM3 variants were identified using all three mutagenesis approaches, with as few as two amino acid substitutions.  The library designed using the CRAM algorithm, which sought to reduce the size of the binding pocket, produced both a higher no. of active variants and variants supporting the greatest no. of catalytic turnovers.  The most active variant E32 supports 16 800 propane turnovers at 36% coupling, which rivals the activity of variants obtained after 10-12 rounds of directed evolution using random and site-satn. mutagenesis.  None of the variants in this study achieved the complete re-specialization for propane hydroxylation (including 93% coupling) previously obtained via multiple rounds of mutagenesis and screening.  However, these semi-rational approaches allowed for large jumps in sequence space to variants with the desired functions. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - A Selenium Analogue of Firefly L-Luciferin with Red-Shifted Bioluminescence Emission.
N2  - The authors have described a selenium-contg. D-luciferin deriv., aminoseleno-D-luciferin, and demonstrated that it is a competent substrate for native firefly luciferase (FLuc), exhibiting a red-shifted bioluminescence signal max. relative to its sulfur-contg. analog amino-D-luciferin.  Although the substitution does not decrease the substrate's affinity for FLuc, it results in less light output in vitro, partly as a result of a lower quantum yield.  For in vivo bioluminescence imaging applications, the substitution is benign; it has no net effect on the emission kinetics, likely because of a trade-off between greater tissue penetration of the bioluminescence emission and a lower quantum yield.

T1  - Identification of mutant firefly luciferases that efficiently utilize aminoluciferins.
N2  - Firefly luciferase-catalyzed light emission from D-luciferin is widely used as a reporter of gene expression and enzymic activity both in vitro and in vivo.  Despite the power of bioluminescence for imaging and drug discovery, light emission from firefly luciferase is fundamentally limited by the phys. properties of the D-luciferin substrate.  The authors and others have previously synthesized aminoluciferin analogs that exhibit light emission at longer wavelengths than D-luciferin and have increased affinity for luciferase.  However, although these substrates can emit an intense initial burst of light that approaches that of D-luciferin, this is followed by much lower levels of sustained light output.  Here, the authors describe the creation of mutant luciferases that yield improved sustained light emission with aminoluciferins in both lysed and live mammalian cells, allowing the use of aminoluciferins for cell-based bioluminescence expts.

T1  - Aminoluciferins as Functional Bioluminogenic Substrates of Firefly Luciferase.
N2  - Firefly luciferase is widely used as a reporter gene in assays to study gene expression, gene delivery, and so on because of its extremely high signal-to-noise ratio.  The availability of a range of bioluminogenic substrates would greatly extend the applicability of the luciferin-luciferase system.  Herein, we describe a design concept for functional bioluminogenic substrates based on the aminoluciferin (AL) scaffold, together with a convenient, high-yield method for synthesizing N-alkylated ALs.  We confirmed the usefulness of ALs as bioluminogenic substrates by synthesizing three probes.  The first was a conjugate of AL with glutamate, Glu-AL.  When Glu-AL, the first membrane-impermeable bioluminogenic substrate of luciferases, was applied to cells transfected with luciferase, luminescence was not obsd.; i.e., by using Glu-AL, we can distinguish between intracellular and extracellular events.  The second was Cy5-AL, which consisted of Cy5, a near-IR (NIR) cyanine fluorescent dye, and AL, and emitted NIR light.  When Cy5-AL reacted with luciferase, luminescence derived from Cy5 was obsd. as a result of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) from AL to Cy5.  The NIR emission wavelength would allow a signal to be obsd. from deeper tissues in bioluminescence in vivo imaging.  The third was biotin-DEVD-AL (DEVD=the amino acid sequence Asp-Glu-Val-Asp), which employed a caspase-3 substrate peptide as a switch to control the accessibility of the substrate to luciferase, and could detect the activity of caspase-3 in a time-dependent manner.  This generalized design strategy should be applicable to other proteases.  Our results indicate that the AL scaffold is appropriate for a range of functional luminophores and represents a useful alternative substrate to luciferin. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Sensitive dual color in vivo bioluminescence imaging using a new red codon optimized firefly luciferase and a green click beetle luciferase.
N2  - Despite a plethora of bioluminescent reporter genes being cloned and used for cell assays and mol. imaging purposes, the simultaneous monitoring of multiple events in small animals is still challenging.  This is partly attributable to the lack of optimization of cell reporter gene expression as well as too much spectral overlap of the color-coupled reporter genes.  A new red emitting codon-optimized luciferase reporter gene mutant of Photinus pyralis, Ppy RE8, has been developed and used in combination with the green click beetle luciferase, CBG99.  Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were transfected with vectors that expressed red Ppy RE8 and green CBG99 luciferases.  Populations of red and green emitting cells were mixed in different ratios.  After addn. of the shared single substrate, -luciferin, bioluminescent (BL) signals were imaged with an ultrasensitive cooled CCD camera using a series of band pass filters (20 nm).  Spectral unmixing algorithms were applied to the images where good sepn. of signals was obsd.  Furthermore, HEK293 cells that expressed the two luciferases were injected at different depth in the animals.  Spectrally-sep. images and quantification of the dual BL signals in a mixed population of cells was achieved when cells were either injected s.c. or directly into the prostate.  We report here the re-engineering of different luciferase genes for in vitro and in vivo dual color imaging applications to address the tech. issues of using dual luciferases for imaging.  In respect to previously used dual assays, our study demonstrated enhanced sensitivity combined with spatially sep. BL spectral emissions using a suitable spectral unmixing algorithm.  This new -luciferin-dependent reporter gene couplet opens up the possibility in the future for more accurate quant. gene expression studies in vivo by simultaneously monitoring two events in real time.

T1  - Dynamics studies of luciferase using elastic network model: how the sequence distribution of luciferase determines its color.
N2  - Luciferase exhibits a broad range of emitting frequencies.  Light emission from the bioluminescence of luciferase makes it an excellent tool for monitoring gene expression, thus the control of its bioluminescence color has great bio-anal. applications.  Here I use an elastic network model to examine how the sequence distribution of luciferase is related to bioluminescence multicolor emission.  Based on the open and closed forms of crystal structures for luciferase, several computational anal. tools are applied to characterize the functionally relevant dynamical features within luciferase, and probe the dynamical mechanisms underlying the interactions between luciferin (a light-emitting substrate) and luciferase.  Perturbation-based correlation anal. is used to identify hot-spot residues that are dynamically coupled to the active site of luciferase, and the results show that the sequence region of subdomain B of luciferase is largely responsible for detg. the emitting color of bioluminescence.  Moreover, the mode decompn. anal. reveals that the lowest frequency mode is the major contributor to the dynamical couplings between the hot-spot residues and the binding site in luciferase.

T1  - Circular polymerase extension cloning for high-throughput cloning of complex and combinatorial DNA libraries.
N2  - A review.  High-throughput genomics, proteomics and synthetic biol. studies require ever more efficient and economical strategies to clone complex DNA libraries or variants of biol. modules.  In this paper, we provide a protocol for a sequence-independent approach for cloning complex individual or combinatorial DNA libraries, and routine or high-throughput cloning of single or multiple DNA fragments.  The strategy, called circular polymerase extension cloning (CPEC), is based on polymerase overlap extension and is therefore free of restriction digestion, ligation or single-stranded homologous recombination.  CPEC is highly efficient, accurate and user friendly.  Once the inserts and the linear vector have been prepd., the CPEC reaction can be completed in 10 min to 3 h, depending on the complexity of the gene libraries. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Robust Light Emission from Cyclic Alkylaminoluciferin Substrates for Firefly Luciferase.
N2  - Firefly luciferase utilizes the chem. energy of ATP and oxygen to convert its substrate, D-luciferin, into an excited-state oxyluciferin mol.  Relaxation of this mol. to the ground state is responsible for the yellow-green light emission.  Synthetic cyclic alkylaminoluciferins that allow robust red-shifted light emission with the modified luciferase Ultra-Glo are described.  Overall light emission is higher than that of acyclic alkylaminoluciferins, aminoluciferin, and the native substrate D-luciferin. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Iterative Saturation Mutagenesis Accelerates Laboratory Evolution of Enzyme Stereoselectivity: Rigorous Comparison with Traditional Methods.
N2  - Efficacy in lab. evolution of enzymes is currently a pressing issue, making comparative studies of different methods and strategies mandatory.  Recent reports indicate that iterative satn. mutagenesis (ISM) provides a means to accelerate directed evolution of stereoselectivity and thermostability, but statistically meaningful comparisons with other methods have not been documented to date.  In the present study, the efficacy of ISM has been rigorously tested by applying it to the previously most systematically studied enzyme in directed evolution, the lipase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a catalyst in the stereoselective hydrolytic kinetic resoln. of a chiral ester.  Upon screening only 10,000 transformants, unprecedented enantioselectivity was achieved (E = 594).  ISM proves to be considerably more efficient than all previous systematic efforts utilizing error-prone polymerase chain reaction at different mutation rates, satn. mutagenesis at hot spots, and/or DNA shuffling, pronounced pos. epistatic effects being the underlying reason.

T1  - Guided by the light: visualizing biomolecular processes in living animals with bioluminescence.
N2  - A review.  Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) exploits the light-emitting properties of luciferase enzymes for monitoring cells and biomol. processes in living subjects.  Luciferases can be incorporated into a variety of nonluminescent hosts and used to track cells, visualize gene expression, and analyze collections of biomols.  This article highlights recent applications of BLI to studies of mammalian biol., along with the development of novel bioluminescent probes to see' cells and mols. in action.  Collectively, these efforts are expanding the authors' understanding of living systems and shedding light on the mol. underpinnings of disease. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - N-Alkylated 6'-Aminoluciferins Are Bioluminescent Substrates for Ultra-Glo and QuantiLum Luciferase: New Potential Scaffolds for Bioluminescent Assays.
N2  - A set of 6'-alkylated aminoluciferins are shown to be bioluminescent substrates for Ultra-Glo and QuantiLum luciferases.  These studies demonstrate that both the engineered and wild-type firefly luciferases tolerate much greater steric bulk at the 6' position of luciferin than has been previously reported.  The nature of the alkyl substituent strongly affects the strength of the bioluminescent signal, which varies widely based on size, shape, and charge.  Several compds. were obsd. to generate more light than the corresponding unsubstituted 6'-aminoluciferin.  Detn. of Michaelis-Menten consts. for the substrates with Ultra-Glo indicated that the variation arises primarily from differences in Vmax, ranging from 1.33 × 104 to 332 × 104 relative light units, but in some cases Km (0.73-10.8 μM) also plays a role.  Mol. modeling results suggest that interactions of the side chain with a hydrogen-bonding network at the base of the luciferin binding pocket may influence substrate-enzyme binding.

T1  - Addressing the numbers problem in directed evolution.
N2  - Our previous contribution to increasing the efficiency of directed evolution is iterative satn. mutagenesis (ISM) as a systematic means of generating focused libraries for the control of substrate acceptance, enantioselectivity, or thermostability of enzymes.  We have now introduced a crucial element to knowledge-guided targeted mutagenesis in general that helps to solve the nos. problem in directed evolution.  We show that the choice of the amino acid (aa) alphabet, as specified by the utilized codon degeneracy, provides the experimenter with a powerful tool in designing "smarter" randomized libraries that require considerably less screening effort.  A systematic comparison of two different codon degeneracies was made by examg. the relative quality of the identically sized enzyme libraries in relation to the degree of oversampling required in the screening process.  The specific example in our case study concerns the conventional NNK codon degeneracy (32 codons/20 aa) vs. NDT (12 codons/12 aa).  The model reaction is the hydrolytic kinetic resoln. of a chiral trans-disubstituted epoxide, catalyzed by the epoxide hydrolase from Aspergillus niger.  The NDT library proves to be of much higher quality, as measured by the dramatically higher frequency of pos. variants and by the magnitude of catalyst improvement (enhanced rate and enantioselectivity).  We provide a statistical anal. that constitutes a useful guide for the optimal design and generation of "smarter" focused libraries.  This type of approach accelerates the process of lab. evolution considerably and can be expected to be broadly applicable when engineering functional proteins in general. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Synergistic Mutations Produce Blue-Shifted Bioluminescence in Firefly Luciferase.
N2  - Luciferase-dependent yellow-green (557 nm) light emission from the North American firefly Photinus pyralis is widely believed to be the most efficient bioluminescence system known, making this luciferase (Luc; E.C. 1.13.12.7) an excellent tool for monitoring gene expression.  In a previous study designed to produce luciferases for simultaneously monitoring two gene expression events, we identified a very promising blue-shifted emitter (548 nm) that contained the mutations Val241Ile, Gly246Ala, and Phe250Ser.  To establish the basis of the unusual blue-shifted emission, we detd. that a simple additive effect of the three individual mutations did not account for the spectral properties of the triple mutant.  Instead, the bioluminescence emission spectra of two double mutants contg. Phe250Ser and either Val241Ile or Gly246Ala very closely resembled that of the triple mutant.  Addnl. mutagenesis results confirmed that the blue-shifted emission of the double mutants was detd. by the synergistic behavior of active site residues.  Mol. modeling studies of the Gly246Ala and Phe250Ser double mutant supported the notion that the blue-shifted emission was due to localized changes that increased the hydrophobicity at the emitter site as a result of the addn. of a single Me group at position 246.  Moreover, the modeling data suggested that the Ala246 side chain remained close to the emitter through an addnl. H-bond between the main chain carbonyl of Ala246 and the hydroxyl group of Ser250, providing a possible structural basis for the synergistic behavior. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Reporter gene imaging of protein-protein interactions in living subjects.
N2  - A review.  In the past few years there has been a veritable explosion in the field of reporter gene imaging, with the aim of detg. the location, duration and extent of gene expression within living subjects.  An important application of this approach is the mol. imaging of interacting protein partners, which could pave the way to functional proteomics in living animals and might provide a tool for the whole-body evaluation of new pharmaceuticals targeted to modulate protein-protein interactions.  Three general methods are currently available for imaging protein-protein interactions in living subjects using reporter genes: a modified mammalian two-hybrid system, a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) system, and split reporter protein complementation and reconstitution strategies.  In the future, these innovative approaches are likely to enhance our appreciation of entire biol. pathway systems and their pharmacol. regulation. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Thermostable red and green light-producing firefly luciferase mutants for bioluminescent reporter applications.
N2  - Light emission from the North American firefly Photinus pyralis, which emits yellow-green (557-nm) light, is widely believed to be the most efficient bioluminescence system known, making this luciferase an excellent tool for monitoring gene expression.  The authors present studies on the prodn. of a set of thermostable red- and green-emitting luciferase mutants with bioluminescent properties suitable for dual-color reporter assays, biosensor measurements with internal controls, and imaging techniques.  Starting with the luciferase variant Ser284Thr, the authors introduced the mutations Thr214Ala, Ala215Leu, Ile232Ala, Phe295Leu, and Glu354Lys to produce a new red-emitting enzyme with a bioluminescence max. of 610 nm, narrow emission bandwidth, favorable kinetic properties, and excellent thermostability at 37°.  By adding the same five changes to luciferase mutant Val241Ile/Gly246Ala/Phe250Ser, the authors produced a protein with an emission max. of 546 nm, providing a set of thermostable enzymes whose bioluminescence maxima were sepd. by 64 nm.  Model studies established that the luciferases could be detected at the attomole level and six orders of magnitude higher.  In microplate luminometer format, mixts. contg. 1.0 fmol total luciferase were quantified from measurements of simultaneously emitted red and green light.  The results presented here provide evidence that it is feasible to monitor two distinct activities at 37° with these novel thermostable proteins. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Luciferin Derivatives for Enhanced in Vitro and in Vivo Bioluminescence Assays.
N2  - In vivo bioluminescence imaging has become a cornerstone technol. for preclin. mol. imaging.  This imaging method is based on light-emitting enzymes, luciferases, which require specific substrates for light prodn.  When linked to a specific biol. process in an animal model of human biol. or disease, the enzyme-substrate interactions become biol. indicators that can be studied noninvasively in living animals.  Signal intensity in these animal models depends on the availability of the substrate for the reaction within living cells in intact organs.  The biodistribution and clearance rates of the substrates are therefore directly related to optimal imaging times and signal intensities and ultimately det. the sensitivity of detection and predictability of the model.  Modifications of D-luciferin, the substrate for the luciferases obtained from beetle, including fireflies, result in novel properties and offer opportunities for improved bioassays.  For this purpose, the authors have synthesized a conjugate, glycine-D-aminoluciferin, and investigated its properties relative to those of D-aminoluciferin and D-luciferin.  The three substrates exhibited different kinetic properties and different intracellular accumulation profiles due to differences in their mol. structure, which in turn influenced their biodistribution in animals.  Glycine-D-aminoluciferin had a longer in vivo circulation time than the other two substrates.  The ability to assay luciferase in vitro and in vivo using these substrates, which exhibit different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, will provide flexibility and improve current imaging capabilities.

T1  - Structural basis for the spectral difference in luciferase bioluminescence.
N2  - Fireflies communicate with each other by emitting yellow-green to yellow-orange brilliant light.  The bioluminescence reaction, which uses luciferin, Mg-ATP, and O2 to yield an electronically excited oxyluciferin species, is carried out by firefly luciferase (I).  Visible light is emitted during relaxation of excited oxyluciferin to its ground state.  The high quantum yield of the luciferin/I reaction and the change in bioluminescence color caused by subtle structural differences in I have attracted much research interest.  In fact, a single amino acid substitution in I changes the emission color from yellow-green to red.  Although the crystal structure of I from the North American firefly (Photinus pyralis) has been described, the detailed mechanism for the bioluminescence color change is still unclear.  Here, the authors report the crystal structures of wild-type and red mutant (S286N) I from the Japanese Genji-botaru (Luciola cruciata) in complex with a high-energy intermediate analog, 5'-O-[N-(dehydroluciferyl)sulfamoyl]adenosine (DLSA).  Comparing these structures to those of the wild-type luciferase complexed with AMP plus oxyluciferin (products) revealed a significant conformational change in the wild-type enzyme but not in the red mutant.  This conformational change involved movement of the hydrophobic side-chain of Ile-288 toward the benzothiazole ring of DLSA.  The results indicated that the degree of mol. rigidity of the excited state of oxyluciferin, which is controlled by a transient movement of Ile-288, dets. the color of bioluminescence during the emission reaction.

T1  - Emission spectra of bioluminescent reporters and interaction with mammalian tissue determine the sensitivity of detection in vivo.
N2  - In vivo bioluminescence imaging depends on light emitted by luciferases in the body overcoming the effect of tissue attenuation.  Understanding this relationship is essential for detection and quantification of signal.  The authors have studied four codon optimized luciferases with different emission spectra, including enzymes from firefly (FLuc), click beetle (CBGr68, CBRed) and Renilla reniformins (hRLuc).  At 25°C, the in vitro λmax of these reporters are 578, 543, 615, and 480 nm, resp.; at body temp., 37°C, the brightness increases and the firefly enzyme demonstrates a 34-nm spectral red shift.  Spectral shifts and attenuation due to tissue effects were evaluated using a series of 20-nm bandpass filters and a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera.  Attenuation increased and the spectra of emitted light was red shifted for signals originating from deeper within the body relative to superficial origins.  The tissue attenuation of signals from CBGr68 and hRLuc was greater than from those of Fluc and CBRed.  To further probe tissue effects, broad spectral emitters were created through gene fusions between CBGr68 and CBRed.  These resulted in enzymes with broader emission spectra, featuring two peaks whose intensities are differentially affected by temp. and tissue depth.  These spectral measurement data allow for improved understanding of how these reporters can be used in vivo and what they can reveal about biol. processes in living subjects. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Imaging reversal of multidrug resistance in living mice with bioluminescence: MDR1 P-glycoprotein transports coelenterazine.
N2  - Coelenterazine is widely distributed among marine organisms, producing bioluminescence by calcium-insensitive oxidn. mediated by Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and calcium-dependent oxidn. mediated by the photoprotein aequorin.  Despite its abundance in nature and wide use of both proteins as reporters of gene expression and signal transduction, little is known about mechanisms of coelenterazine transport and cell permeation.  Interestingly, coelenterazine analogs share structural and physiochem. properties of compds. transported by the multidrug resistance MDR1 P-glycoprotein (Pgp).  Herein, we report that living cells stably transfected with a codon-humanized Rluc show coelenterazine-mediated bioluminescence in a highly MDR1 Pgp-modulated manner.  In Pgp-expressing Rluc cells, low baseline bioluminescence could be fully enhanced (reversed) to non-Pgp matched control levels with potent and selective Pgp inhibitors.  Therefore, using coelenterazine and noninvasive bioluminescence imaging in vivo, we could directly monitor tumor-specific Pgp transport inhibition in living mice.  While enabling mol. imaging and high-throughput screening of drug resistance pathways, these data also raise concern for the indiscriminate use of Rluc and aequorin as reporters in intact cells or transgenic animals, wherein Pgp-mediated alterations in coelenterazine permeability may impact results.

T1  - A Mutagenesis Study of the Putative Luciferin Binding Site Residues of Firefly Luciferase.
N2  - Firefly luciferase catalyzes the highly efficient emission of yellow-green light from substrate firefly luciferin by a sequence of reactions that require Mg-ATP and mol. oxygen.  The authors had previously developed a mol. graphics-based working model of the luciferase active site starting with the first x-ray structure of the enzyme without bound substrates.  In the authors' model, the luciferin binding site contains 15 residues that are within 5 Å of the substrate.  Using site-directed mutagenesis, the authors made changes at all of these residues and report the characterization of the corresponding expressed and purified proteins.  Of the 15 residues studied, 12 had a significantly (≥4-fold Km difference) altered binding affinity for luciferin and seven residues, spanning the primary sequence region Arg-218-Ala-348, had substantially (≥30 nm) red-shifted bioluminescence emission maxima when mutated.  The authors report an interpretation of the roles of the mutated residues in substrate binding and bioluminescence color detn.  The results of this study generally substantiate the accuracy of the authors' model and provide the foundation for future expts. designed to alter the substrate specificity of firefly luciferase.

T1  - The origin, diversity, and structure function relationships of insect luciferases.
N2  - A review.  Luciferases are enzymes that catalyze the reactions that produce light in bioluminescence.  Whereas the oxidative mechanism which leads to light emission is similar for most luciferases, these enzymes and their substrates are evolutionarily unrelated.  Among all bioluminescent groups, insects constitute one of the most diverse in terms of biochem.  In the fungus-gnats (Mycetophilidae: Diptera), e.g., bioluminescence is generated by 2 biochem. distinct systems.  Despite the diversity, investigations on insect luciferases and biochem. have been conducted mostly with fireflies.  The luciferases from the related phengodid beetles, which can produce green-to-red bioluminescence using the same chem. as firefly luciferases, have been recently investigated.  Beetle luciferases originated from ancestral acyl-CoA ligases.  The present data suggest that conserved motifs among this class of ligases are involved in substrate adenylylation.  The 3-dimensional structure of firefly luciferase has recently been solved and mutagenesis studies have been performed identifying putative residues involved in luciferin binding and bioluminescence color detn. in several beetle luciferases.  The knowledge gained through these studies is helpful in the development of useful reporter gene tools for biotechnol. and biomedical purposes. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Synthetic shuffling expands functional protein diversity by allowing amino acids to recombine independently.
N2  - The authors describe synthetic shuffling, an evolutionary protein engineering technol. in which every amino acid from a set of parents is allowed to recombine independently of every other amino acid.  With the use of degenerate oligonucleotides, synthetic shuffling provides a direct route from database sequence information to functional libraries.  Phys. starting genes are unnecessary, and addnl. design criteria such as optimal codon usage or known beneficial mutations can also be incorporated.  The authors performed synthetic shuffling of 15 subtilisin genes and obtained active and highly chimeric enzymes with desirable combinations of properties that the authors did not obtain by other directed-evolution methods.

T1  - Optical imaging of Renilla luciferase reporter gene expression in living mice.
N2  - Imaging reporter gene expression in living subjects is a rapidly evolving area of mol. imaging research.  Studies have validated the use of reporter genes with positron emission tomog. (PET), single photon emission computed tomog. (SPECT), MRI, fluorescence with wild-type and mutants of green fluorescent protein, as well as bioluminescence using Firefly luciferase enzyme/protein (FL).  In the current study, we validate for the first time the ability to image bioluminescence from Renilla luciferase enzyme/protein (RL) by injecting the substrate coelenterazine in living mice.  A highly sensitive cooled charge-coupled device camera provides images within a few minutes of photon counting.  Cells, transiently expressing the Rluc were imaged while located in the peritoneum, s.c. layer, as well as in the liver and lungs of living mice tail-vein injected with coelenterazine.  Furthermore, D-luciferin (a substrate for FL) does not serve as a substrate for RL, and coelenterazine does not serve as a substrate for FL either in cell culture or in living mice.  We also show that both Rluc and Fluc expression can be imaged in the same living mouse and that the kinetics of light prodn. are distinct.  The approaches validated will have direct applications to various studies where two mol. events need to be tracked, including cell trafficking of two cell populations, two gene therapy vectors, and indirect monitoring of two endogenous genes through the use of two reporter genes.

T1  - The role of active site residue arginine 218 in firefly luciferase bioluminescence.
N2  - Firefly luciferase (I) catalyzes the highly efficient emission of yellow-green light from firefly luciferin by a sequence of reactions that require Mg-ATP and O2.  The authors previously developed a working model of the I active site based on the x-ray structure of the enzyme without bound substrates.  In this model, the side-chain guanidinium group of Arg-218 appeared to be located in close proximity to the substrate OH group at the bottom of the luciferin-binding pocket.  A similar role for Arg-337 was also proposed by other investigators.  Here, the construction, purifn., and characterization of I mutants R218A, R218Q, R218K, R337Q, and R337K are reported.  It was found that alteration of the Arg-218 side-chain produced mutant enzymes with 15-20-fold increases in their Km values for luciferin.  The contrasting near-normal Km values for luciferin detd. with the Arg-337 mutant enzymes supported the authors' proposal that Arg-218 (and not Arg-337) is an essential luciferin-binding site residue.  Bioluminescence emission studies indicated that in the absence of a pos. charged group at position 218, red bioluminescence was produced.  Based on this result and those of addnl. fluorescence expts., the authors speculate that Arg-218 maintains the polarity and rigidity of the emitter binding site necessary for the normal yellow-green emission of P. pyralis luciferase.  The findings reported here are interpreted in the context of the I x-ray structures and computational-based models of the active site. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Visualizing gene expression in living mammals using a bioluminescent reporter.
N2  - Control of gene expression often involves an interwoven set of regulatory processes.  As information regarding regulatory pathways may be lost in ex vivo analyses, we used bioluminescence to monitor gene expression in living mammals.  Viral promoters fused to firefly luciferase as transgenes in mice allowed external monitoring of gene expression both superficially and in deep tissues.  In vivo bioluminescence was detectable using either intensified or cooled charge-coupled device cameras, and could be detected following both topical and systemic delivery of substrate.  In vivo control of the promoter from the human immunodeficiency virus was demonstrated.  As a model for DNA-based therapies and vaccines, in vivo transfection of a luciferase expression vector (SV-40 promoter and enhancer controlling expression) was detected.  We conclude that gene regulation, DNA delivery and expression can now be noninvasively monitored in living mammals using a luciferase reporter.  Thus, real-time, noninvasive study of gene expression in living animal models for human development and disease is possible. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Naphthyl- and quinolylluciferin:  green and red light emitting firefly luciferin analogs.
N2  - In the course of investigations on the possible involvement of the CIEEL (chem. initiated electron-exchange luminescence) mechanism in firefly bioluminescence, 2 novel firefly luciferin substrate analogs, D-naphthylluciferin and D-quinolylluciferin, were prepd. by condensing D-cysteine with 2-cyano-6-hydroxynaphthalene and 2-cyano-6-hydroxyquinoline, resp.  These analogs are the first examples of bioluminescent substrates for firefly luciferase that do not contain a benzothiazole moiety.  Firefly luciferase-catalyzed bioluminescence emission spectra revealed that compared to the normal yellow-green light of luciferin (λmax = 559 nm), the emission from naphthylluciferin is significantly blue-shifted (λmax = 524 nm), whereas quinolylluciferin emits orange-red light (λmax = 608 nm).  The fluorescence emission spectra, reaction pH optima, relative light yields, light emission kinetics, and Km values of the analogs also were measured and compared to those of luciferin.  Neither of the analogs produced the characteristic flash kinetics obsd. for the natural substrate.  Instead, slower rise times to peak emission intensity were recorded.  It appears that the formation of an intermediate from the analog adenylates prior to the addn. of O is responsible for the slow rise times. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Chemiluminescence of firefly luciferin.  Model for the bioluminescent reaction and identification of the product excited state.
N2  - Firefly bioluminescence involves enzyme-catalyzed oxidn. of luciferyl adenylate (I).  Since the product of the chemiluminescence reaction with I was too unstable to isolate, the more stable 5',5-dimethyl deriv. of I was used effectively as a model compd. in the study of the reaction mechanism.  A monoanion was synthesized which is probably the 5,5-dimethyl analog of the compd. which, in its excited state, produces the red bioluminescent and chemiluminescent emissions of the I reaction.

T1  - Amino analogs of firefly luciferin and biological activity thereof.
N2  - For this study of the mechanism of firefly bioluminescence, the compds. 2-(6'-amino-2'-benzothiazolyl)-Δ2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid ("amino-luciferin"), 2-(6'-acetylamino-2'-benzothiazolyl)- Δ2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid, and 2-(6'-trifluoroacetylamino-2'-benzothia-zolyl)-Δ2-thiazoline-4-carboxylic acid were synthesized and characterized.  Of these compds. only aminoluciferin reacted with firefly luciferase and ATP to produce light.  The bioluminescence emission was red and pH independent, unlike the reaction with natural luciferin, which emits in the yellow-green at neutral and alk. pH and in the red at acid pH.  The fluorescence of aminoluciferin is compared with that of native luciferin. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - Stereospecificity and firefly bioluminescence, a comparison of natural and synthetic luciferins.
N2  - cf. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 83, 2402-3 (1961).  --In the final step of chem. synthesis of luciferin, 2-cyano-6-hydroxybenzothiazole is treated with D- or L-cysteine.  The resulting D-luciferin reacts exactly as the natural luciferin with the identical bioluminescence emission spectra between 562 and 565 mμ at neutral pH, a red-shift at acid pH.  The L-luciferin apparently reacts the same, but gives no light emission.  Its chem. properties are the same as natural and D-luciferin, and it may be converted to D-luciferin by an alkali-catalyzed isomerization.  Natural, and synthetic D- and L-luciferins have identical absorbance with peaks at 327 mμ at pH 7 or below and 381 at alk. pH.  They have identical fluorescence with a 535 mμ peak.  The D- and L-luciferins have [α]D -30° and +30°, (dimethylformamide), resp. [on SciFinder(R)]

T1  - The luciferin binding site residues C/T311 (S314) influence the bioluminescence color of beetle luciferases through main-chain interaction with oxyluciferin phenolate
N2  - Beetle luciferases emit different bioluminescence colors from green to red; however, no clear relationship between the identity of the luciferin binding site residues and bioluminescence colors was found in different luciferases, and it is unclear whether critical interactions affecting emission spectra occur on the thiazolyl or on the benzothiazolyl sides of the luciferin binding site.  Through homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis using our multicolor set of beetle luciferases (Pyrearinus termitilluminans larval click beetle, Pte, λ(max) = 534 nm; Phrixothrix hirtus railroad worm red emitting, PxRE, λ(max) = 623 nm; and Macrolampis sp2 firefly, Mac, λ(max) = 564 nm), we show that the residues C/T311 (S314) play an important role in bioluminescence color determination.  Modeling studies indicate that the main-chain carbonyls of these residues are close to both oxyluciferin phenolate and AMP, whereas the side chains pack against second-shell residues.  The C311(S314)A mutation considerably red shifts the spectra of the green-yellow-emitting luciferases (Pte λ(max) = 534 to 590 nm; Mac λ(max) = 564 to 583/613 nm) and affects the K(M) values for luciferin and ATP, but not the spectrum of the red-emitting luciferase.  On the other hand, whereas the exchange between C/T311 (S314) caused smaller effects on the emission spectra of green-yellow-emitting luciferases, the C311T substitution (naturally found in green-emitting railroad worm luciferases) resulted in the largest reported blue shift in P. hirtus red-emitting luciferase (λ(max) = 623 to 606 nm).  Altogether, these results indicate that the stability of residues C/T311 (S314) and the size of the cavity around oxyluciferin phenolate affect bioluminescence colors and suggest, for the first time, the occurrence of a critical interaction between main-chain carbonyls of position 311 (314) residues and oxyluciferin phenolate.[on SciFinder (R)]

T1  - The origin, diversity, and structure function relationships of insect luciferases
N2  - Luciferases are the enzymes that catalyze the reactions that produce light in bioluminescence.  Whereas the oxidative mechanism which leads to light emission is similar for most luciferases, these enzymes and their substrates are evolutionarily unrelated.  Among all bioluminescent groups, insects constitute one of the most diverse in terms of biochemistry.  In the fungus-gnats (Mycetophilidae: Diptera), for example, bioluminescence is generated by two biochemically distinct systems.  Despite the diversity, investigations on insect luciferases and biochemistry have been conducted mostly with fireflies.  The luciferases from the related phengodid beetles, which can produce green to red bioluminescence using the same chemistry as firefly luciferases, have been recently investigated.  Beetle luciferases originated from ancestral acyl-CoA ligases.  Present data suggest that conserved motifs among this class of ligases are involved in substrate adenylation.  The three-dimensional structure of firefly luciferase was recently solved and mutagenesis studies have been performed identifying putative residues involved in luciferin binding and bioluminescence color determination in several beetle luciferases.  The knowledge gained through these studies is helping in the development of useful reporter gene tools for biotechnological and biomedical purposes.[on SciFinder (R)]

T1  - Optical imaging of Renilla luciferase reporter gene expression in living mice
N2  - Imaging reporter gene expression in living subjects is a rapidly evolving area of molecular imaging research.  Studies have validated the use of reporter genes with positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), MRI, fluorescence with wild-type and mutants of green fluorescent protein, as well as bioluminescence using Firefly luciferase enzyme/protein (FL).  In the current study, we validate for the first time the ability to image bioluminescence from Renilla luciferase enzyme/protein (RL) by injecting the substrate coelenterazine in living mice.  A highly sensitive cooled charge-coupled device camera provides images within a few minutes of photon counting.  Cells, transiently expressing the Rluc were imaged while located in the peritoneum, s.c. layer, as well as in the liver and lungs of living mice tail-vein injected with coelenterazine.  Furthermore, d-luciferin (a substrate for FL) does not serve as a substrate for RL, and coelenterazine does not serve as a substrate for FL either in cell culture or in living mice.  We also show that both Rluc and Fluc expression can be imaged in the same living mouse and that the kinetics of light production are distinct.  The approaches validated will have direct applications to various studies where two molecular events need to be tracked, including cell trafficking of two cell populations, two gene therapy vectors, and indirect monitoring of two endogenous genes through the use of two reporter genes.[on SciFinder (R)]

T1  - The role of active site residue arginine 218 in firefly luciferase bioluminescence
N2  - Firefly luciferase catalyzes the highly efficient emission of yellow-green light from substrate firefly luciferin by a sequence of reactions that require Mg-ATP and molecular oxygen.  We had previously developed a working model of the luciferase active site based on the X-ray structure of the enzyme without bound substrates.  In our model, the side chain guanidinium group of Arg218 appears to be located in close proximity to the substrate's hydroxyl group at the bottom of the luciferin binding pocket.  A similar role for Arg337 also has been proposed.  We report here the construction, purification, and characterization of mutant luciferases R218A, R218Q, R218K, R337Q, and R337K.  Alteration of the Arg218 side chain produced enzymes with 15-20-fold increases in the Km values for luciferin.  The contrasting near-normal Km values for luciferin determined with the Arg337 enzymes support our proposal that Arg218 (and not Arg337) is an essential luciferin binding site residue.  Bioluminescence emission studies indicated that in the absence of a positively charged group at position 218, red bioluminescence was produced.  Based on this result and those of additional fluorescence experiments, we speculate that Arg218 maintains the polarity and rigidity of the emitter binding site necessary for the normal yellow-green emission of P. pyralis luciferase.  The findings reported here are interpreted in the context of the firefly luciferase X-ray structures and computational-based models of the active site.[on SciFinder (R)]

T1  - Visualizing gene expression in living mammals using a bioluminescent reporter
N2  - Control of gene expression often involves an interwoven set of regulatory processes.  As information regarding regulatory pathways may be lost in ex vivo analyses, we used bioluminescence to monitor gene expression in living mammals.  Viral promoters fused to firefly luciferase as transgenes in mice allowed external monitoring of gene expression both superficially and in deep tissues.  In vivo bioluminescence was detectable using either intensified or cooled charge-coupled device cameras, and could be detected following both topical and systemic delivery of substrate.  In vivo control of the promoter from the human immunodeficiency virus was demonstrated.  As a model for DNA-based therapies and vaccines, in vivo transfection of a luciferase expression vector (SV-40 promoter and enhancer controlling expression) was detected.  We conclude that gene regulation, DNA delivery and expression can now be noninvasively monitored in living mammals using a luciferase reporter.  Thus, real-time, noninvasive study of gene expression in living animal models for human development and disease is possible.[on SciFinder (R)]

T1  - Naphthyl- and quinolylluciferin: green and red light emitting firefly luciferin analogues
N2  - In the course of investigations on the possible involvement of the CIEEL (chemically initiated electron-exchange luminescence) mechanism in firefly bioluminescence, we have synthesized two novel firefly luciferin substrate analogues.  D-Naphthylluciferin and D-quinolylluciferin were prepared by condensing D-cysteine with 2-cyano-6-hydroxynaphthalene and 2-cyano-6-hydroxyquinoline, respectively.  These analogues are the first examples of bioluminescent substrates for firefly luciferase that do not contain a benzothiazole moiety.  Firefly luciferase-catalyzed bioluminescence emission spectra revealed that compared to the normal yellow-green light of luciferin (lambda max = 559 nm), the emission from naphthylluciferin is significantly blue-shifted (lambda max = 524 nm); whereas quinolylluciferin emits orange-red light (lambda max = 608 nm).  The fluorescence emission spectra, reaction pH optima, relative light yields, light emission kinetics and KM values of the analogues also were measured and compared to those of luciferin.  Neither of the analogues produced the characteristic flash kinetics observed for the natural substrate.  Instead, slower rise times to peak emission intensity were recorded.  It appears that the formation of an intermediate from the analogue adenylates prior to the addition of oxygen is responsible for the slow rise times.  The synthetic substrate analogues described here should be useful for future mechanistic studies.[on SciFinder (R)]
