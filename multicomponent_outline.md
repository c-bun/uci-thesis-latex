# introduction
- some discussion here about measuring two to three things in a single session?

# Results and Discussion
## Intensity resolution distinguishes orthogonal bioluminescent probes

- illustrate whatever pair is best for initial tests
  - "We chose a panel of mutants that paired well with 4Br and Dluc for our initial tests in bacterial cells."
  - show plot of performance from script runs.
- bacterial expts (8x8 grid)
  - can also use spectral unmixing algorithms to distinguish if not resolved
- mammalian cell expts (triangle)

## Mixed cell populations can be distinguished *in vivo*

- statements about how this is hard with tissue penetrance bioavailability etc.
- mouse screen because didn't know how cmpds/muts would perform
  - images? just plot?
  - mention inconsistency with 51?
- mixed mouse expt with 37 and 51

## MMTV-PyMT cell experiment

# Conclusions and future directions
