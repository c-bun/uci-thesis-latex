  abstract = {ConspectusLight-responsive agents offer the promise of targeted therapy, whose benefits include (i) prolonged action at the target site, (ii) overall reduced systemic dosage, (iii) reduced adverse effects, and (iv) localized delivery of multiple agents. Although photoactivated prodrugs have been reported, these species generally require short wavelengths ($<$450 nm) for activation. However, maximal tissue penetrance by light occurs within the ``optical window of tissue'' (600\textendash{}900 nm), well beyond the wavelength range of most existing photocleavable functional groups. Furthermore, since multidrug therapy holds promise for the treatment of complex diseases, from cancer to neurological disorders, controlling the action of multiple drugs via wavelength modulation would take advantage of a property that is unique to light. However, discrimination between existing photoresponsive moieties has thus far proven to be limited.We have developed a vitamin B12/light-facilitated strategy for controlling drug action using red, far-red, and NIR light. The technology is based on a light-triggered reaction displayed by a subset of B12 derivatives: alkyl-cob(III)alamins suffer photohomolysis of the C\textendash{}Co(III) bond. The C\textendash{}Co(III) bond is weak ($<$30 kcal/mol), and therefore all wavelengths absorbed by the corrin ring (330\textendash{}580 nm) induce photocleavage. In addition, by appending fluorophores to the corrin ring, long wavelength light ($>$600 nm) is readily captured and used to separate the Co-appended ligand (e.g., a drug) from B12. Consequently, it is now feasible to preassign the wavelength of homolysis by simply installing a fluorescent antenna with the desired photophysical properties. The wavelength malleability inherent within this strategy has been used to construct photoresponsive compounds that launch different drugs by simply modulating the wavelength of illumination. In addition, these phototherapeutics have been installed on the surface and interior of cells, such as erythrocytes or neural stem cells, and released upon expoure to the appropriate wavelength. We have shown that cytotoxic agents, such as doxorubicin, anti-inflammatories, such as dexamethasone, and anti- and pro-vascular agents are readily released from cellular vehicles as biologically active agents. We have also demonstrated that the concept of ``optical window of tissue'' phototherapeutics is not just limited to prodrugs. For example, stem cells have received considerable attention in the area of regenerative medicine. Hydrogels serve as scaffolds for stem cell growth and differentiation. We have shown that the formation of hydrogels can be triggered, in the presence of cells, using appropriately designed alkyl-cob(III)alamins and long wavelength light. The potential applications of phototherapeutics are broad and include drug delivery for a variety of indications, tissue engineering, and surgery.},

  abstract = {In synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, and gene therapy, there is a strong demand for orthogonal or externally controlled regulation of gene expression. Here, RNA-based regulatory devices represent a promising emerging alternative to proteins, allowing a fast and direct control of gene expression, as no synthesis of regulatory proteins is required. Besides programmable ribozyme elements controlling mRNA stability, regulatory RNA structures in untranslated regions are highly interesting for engineering approaches. Riboswitches are especially well suited, as they show a modular composition of sensor and response elements, allowing a free combination of different modules in a plug-and-play-like mode. The sensor or aptamer domain specifically interacts with a trigger molecule as a ligand, modulating the activity of the adjacent response domain that controls the expression of the genes located downstream, in most cases at the level of transcription or translation. In this review, we discuss the recent advances and strategies for designing such synthetic riboswitches based on natural or artificial components and readout systems, from trial-and-error approaches to rational design strategies. As the past several years have shown dramatic development in this fascinating field of research, we can give only a limited overview of the basic riboswitch design principles that is far from complete, and we apologize for not being able to consider every successful and interesting approach described in the literature.},

Analysis of their absorption spectra, relative fluorescence quantum yields, and fluorescence lifetimes shows that static quenching occurs in both of these dual-labeled probes and that it is the dominant quenching mechanism in the Cy3.5-BHQ1 probe.

  abstract = {Background: In vitro selection has been shown previously to be a powerful method for isolating nucleic acids with specific ligand-binding functions (`aptamers'). Given this capacity, we have sought to isolate RNA motifs that can confer fluorescent labeling to tagged RNA transcripts, potentially allowing in vivo detection and in vitro spectroscopic analysis of RNAs. Results: Two aptamers that recognize the fluorophore sulforhodamine B were isolated by the in vitro selection process. An unusually large motif of approximately 60 nucleotides is responsible for binding in one RNA (SRB-2). This motif consists of a three-way helical junction with two large, highly conserved unpaired regions. Phosphorothioate mapping with an iodoacetamide-tagged form of the ligand shows that these two regions make close contacts with the fluorophore, suggesting that the two loops combine to form separate halves of a binding pocket. The aptamer binds the fluorophore with high affinity, recognizing both the planar aromatic ring system and a negatively charged sulfonate, a rare example of anion recognition by RNA. An aptamer (FB-1) that specifically binds fluorescein has also been isolated by mutagenesis of a sulforhodamine aptamer followed by re-selection. In a simple in vitro test, SRB-2 and FB-1 have been shown to discriminate between sulforhodamine and fluorescein, specifically localizing each fluorophore to beads tagged with the corresponding aptamer. Conclusions:In addition to serving as a model system for understanding the basis of RNA folding and function, these experiments demonstrate potential applications for the aptamers in transcript double labeling or fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies.},

These RNAs include the Spinach and Spinach2 aptamers, which bind and activate the fluorescence of fluorophores similar to that found in green fluorescent protein. Although additional highly fluorescent RNA\textendash{}fluorophore complexes would extend the utility of this technology, the identification of novel RNA\textendash{}fluorophore complexes is difficult. Current approaches select aptamers on the basis of their ability to bind fluorophores, even though fluorophore binding alone is not sufficient to activate fluorescence. Additionally, aptamers require extensive mutagenesis to efficiently fold and exhibit fluorescence in living cells. Here we describe a platform for rapid generation of highly fluorescent RNA\textendash{}fluorophore complexes that are optimized for function in cells. This procedure involves selection of aptamers on the basis of their binding to fluorophores, coupled with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of millions of aptamers expressed in Escherichia coli. Promising aptamers are then further optimized using a FACS-based directed evolution approach. Using this approach, we identified several novel aptamers, including a 49-nt aptamer, Broccoli. Broccoli binds and activates the fluorescence of (Z)-4-(3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene)-1,2-dimethyl-1H-imidazol-5(4H)-one. Broccoli shows robust folding and green fluorescence in cells, and increased fluorescence relative to Spinach2. This reflects, in part, improved folding in the presence of low cytosolic magnesium concentrations. Thus, this novel fluorescence-based selection approach simplifies the generation of aptamers that are optimized for expression and performance in living cells.},

Known N-recognins in eukaryotes mediate protein ubiquitylation and selective proteolysis by the 26S proteasome. Substrates of N-recognins can be generated when normally embedded destabilizing residues are exposed at the N terminus by proteolytic cleavage. N-degrons can also be generated through modifications of posttranslationally exposed pro-N-degrons of otherwise stable proteins; such modifications include oxidation, arginylation, leucylation, phenylalanylation, and acetylation. Although there are variations in components, degrons, and hierarchical structures, the proteolytic systems based on generation and recognition of N-degrons have been observed in all eukaryotes and prokaryotes examined thus far. The N-end rule pathway regulates homeostasis of various physiological processes, in part, through interaction with small molecules.

We now show that an analogous single-residue code (the N-end rule) operates in an in vitro system derived from mammalian reticulocytes. We also show that the N-end rule has a hierarchical structure. Specifically, amino-terminal Glu and Asp (and also Cys in reticulocytes) are secondary destabilizing residues in that they are destabilizing through their ability to be conjugated to primary destabilizing residues such as Arg. Amino-terminal Gln and Asn are tertiary destabilizing residues in that they are destabilizing through their ability to be converted, via selective deamidation, into secondary destabilizing residues Glu and Asp. Furthermore, in reticulocytes, distinct types of the N-end-recognizing activity are shown to be specific for three classes of primary destabilizing residues: basic (Arg, Lys, His), bulky hydrophobic (Phe, Leu, Trp, Tyr), and small uncharged (Ala, Ser, Thr). Features of the N-end rule in reticulocytes suggest that the exact form of the N-end rule may depend on the cell's physiological state, thereby providing a mechanism for selective destruction of preexisting proteins upon cell differentiation.},

  abstract = {Summary
To execute accurate movements, animals must continuously adapt their behavior to changes in their~bodies and environments. Animals can learn changes in the relationship between their locomotor commands and the resulting distance moved, then adjust command strength to achieve a desired travel distance. It is largely unknown which circuits implement this form of motor learning, or how. Using whole-brain neuronal imaging and circuit manipulations in larval zebrafish, we discovered that the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) mediates short-term locomotor learning. Serotonergic DRN neurons respond phasically to swim-induced visual motion, but little to motion that is not self-generated. During prolonged exposure to a given motosensory gain, persistent DRN activity emerges that stores the learned efficacy of motor commands and adapts future locomotor drive for tens of seconds. The DRN's ability to track the effectiveness of motor intent may constitute a computational building block~for the broader functions of the serotonergic system.

Using structure-based mutagenesis and neuron-based screening, we developed a family of ultrasensitive protein calcium sensors (GCaMP6) that outperformed other sensors in cultured neurons and in zebrafish, flies and mice in vivo. In layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the mouse visual cortex, GCaMP6 reliably detected single action potentials in neuronal somata and orientation-tuned synaptic calcium transients in individual dendritic spines. The orientation tuning of structurally persistent spines was largely stable over timescales of weeks. Orientation tuning averaged across spine populations predicted the tuning of their parent cell. Although the somata of GABAergic neurons showed little orientation tuning, their dendrites included highly tuned dendritic segments (5\textendash{}40-$\mathrm{\mu}$m long). GCaMP6 sensors thus provide new windows into the organization and dynamics of neural circuits over multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

We demonstrate long-term imaging of synaptic vesicle dynamics in cultured neurons as well as in intact zebrafish. We found axon initial segment utilizes a ``waterfall'' mechanism gating synaptic vesicle transport polarity by promoting anterograde transport processivity. Long-time observation also reveals that transcription factor hops between clustered binding sites in spatially restricted subnuclear regions, suggesting that topological structures in the nucleus shape local gene activities by a sequestering mechanism. This strategy thus greatly expands the spatiotemporal length scales of live-cell single-molecule measurements, enabling new experiments to quantitatively understand complex control of molecular dynamics in vivo.},

  abstract = {The when, where, and how of translation
High-resolution single-molecule imaging shows the spatial and temporal dynamics of molecular events (see the Perspective by Iwasaki and Ingolia). Wu et al. and Morisaki et al. developed an approach to study the translation of single messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in live cells. Nascent polypeptides containing multimerized epitopes were imaged with fluorescent antibody fragments, while simultaneously detecting the single mRNAs using a different fluorescent tag. The approach enabled a direct readout of initiation and elongation, as well as revealing the spatial distribution of translation and allowing the correlation of polysome motility with translation dynamics. Membrane-targeted mRNAs could be distinguished from cytoplasmic mRNAs, as could single polysomes from higher-order polysomal complexes. Furthermore, the work reveals the stochasticity of translation, which can occur constitutively or in bursts, much like transcription, and the spatial regulation of translation in neuronal dendrites.
Science, this issue p. 1430, p. 1425; see also p. 1391
Although messenger RNA (mRNA) translation is a fundamental biological process, it has never been imaged in real time in vivo with single-molecule precision. To achieve this, we developed nascent chain tracking (NCT), a technique that uses multi-epitope tags and antibody-based fluorescent probes to quantify protein synthesis dynamics at the single-mRNA level. NCT reveals an elongation rate of \textasciitilde{}10 amino acids per second, with initiation occurring stochastically every \textasciitilde{}30 seconds. Polysomes contain \textasciitilde{}1 ribosome every 200 to 900 nucleotides and are globular rather than elongated in shape. By developing multicolor probes, we showed that most polysomes act independently; however, a small fraction (\textasciitilde{}5\%) form complexes in which two distinct mRNAs can be translated simultaneously. The sensitivity and versatility of NCT make it a powerful new tool for quantifying mRNA translation kinetics.
Tracking nascent protein chains in living cells with antibody-based probes reveals the stochastic nature of single mRNA translation.

  abstract = {Fluorescent probe rhodamine was appended to 5? OH?ribose of cobalamin (Cbl). The prepared conjugate, CBC, bound to the transporting proteins, intrinsic factor (IF) and transcobalamin (TC), responsible for the uptake of Cbl in an organism. Pronounced increase in fluorescence upon CBC attachment facilitated detailed kinetic analysis of Cbl binding. We found that TC had the same affinity for CBC and Cbl (Kd?=?5???10?15?m), whereas interaction of CBC with the highly specific protein IF was more complex. For instance, CBC behaved normally in the partial reactions CBC?+?IF30 and CBC?+?IF20 when binding to the isolated IF fragments (domains). The ligand could also assemble them into a stable complex IF30?CBC?IF20 with higher fluorescent signal. However, dissociation of IF30?CBC?IF20 and IF?CBC was accelerated by factors of 3 and 20, respectively, when compared to the corresponding Cbl complexes. We suggest that the correct domain?domain interactions are the most important factor during recognition and fixation of the ligands by IF. Dissociation of IF?CBC was biphasic, and existence of multiple protein?analogue complexes with normal and partially corrupted structure may explain this behaviour. The most stable component had Kd?=?1.5???10?13?m, which guarantees the binding of CBC to IF under physiological conditions. The specific intestinal receptor cubilin bound both IF?CBC and IF?Cbl with equal affinity. In conclusion, the fluorescent analogue CBC can be used as a reporting agent in the kinetic studies, moreover, it seems to be applicable for imaging purposes in vivo.},

These classes share a common cobalamin-binding core, but use distinct peripheral extensions to recognize different B12 derivatives. In each case, recognition is accomplished through shape complementarity between the RNA and cobalamin, with relatively few hydrogen bonding interactions that typically govern RNA\textendash{}small molecule recognition. We show that a composite cobalamin\textendash{}RNA scaffold stabilizes an unusual long-range intramolecular kissing-loop interaction that controls mRNA expression.

Nowadays these approaches can be divided into two categories, one based on targeted switching and readout, and the other based on stochastic switching and readout of the fluorescence information. The main prerequisite for a successful implementation of both categories is the ability to prepare the fluorescent emitters in two distinct states, a bright and a dark state. Herein, we provide an overview of recent developments in super?resolution microscopy techniques and outline the special requirements for the fluorescent probes used. In combination with the advances in understanding the photophysics and photochemistry of single fluorophores, we demonstrate how essentially any single?molecule compatible fluorophore can be used for super?resolution microscopy. We present examples for super?resolution microscopy with standard organic fluorophores, discuss factors that influence resolution and present approaches for calibration samples for super?resolution microscopes including AFM?based single?molecule assembly and DNA origami.},

Here, we describe a modular approach to image RNA in living cells using an RNA aptamer that binds to dinitroaniline, an efficient general contact quencher. Dinitroaniline quenches the fluorescence of different fluorophores when directly conjugated to them via ethylene glycol linkers by forming a non-fluorescent intramolecular complex. Since the binding of the RNA aptamer to the quencher destroys the fluorophore-quencher complex, fluorescence increases dramatically upon binding. Using this principle, a series of fluorophores were turned into fluorescent turn-on probes by conjugating them to dinitroaniline. These probes ranged from fluorescein-dinitroaniline (green) to TexasRed-dinitroaniline (red) spanning across the visible spectrum. The dinitroaniline-binding aptamer (DNB) was generated by in vitro selection, and was found to bind all probes, leading to fluorescence increase in vitro and in living cells. When expressed in E. coli, the DNB aptamer could be labelled and visualized with different-coloured fluorophores and therefore it can be used as a genetically encoded tag to image target RNAs. Furthermore, combining contact-quenched fluorogenic probes with orthogonal DNB (the quencher-binding RNA aptamer) and SRB-2 aptamers (a fluorophore-binding RNA aptamer) allowed dual-colour imaging of two different fluorescence-enhancing RNA tags in living cells, opening new avenues for studying RNA co-localization and trafficking.},

  abstract = {Because RNA lacks strong intrinsic fluorescence, it has proven challenging to track RNA molecules in real time. To address this problem and to allow the purification of fluorescently tagged RNA complexes, we have selected a high affinity RNA aptamer called RNA Mango. This aptamer binds a series of thiazole orange (fluorophore) derivatives with nanomolar affinity, while increasing fluorophore fluorescence by up to 1,100-fold. Visualization of RNA Mango by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, together with injection and imaging of RNA Mango/fluorophore complex in C. elegans gonads demonstrates the potential for live-cell RNA imaging with this system. By inserting RNA Mango into a stem loop of the bacterial 6S RNA and biotinylating the fluorophore, we demonstrate that the aptamer can be used to simultaneously fluorescently label and purify biologically important RNAs. The high affinity and fluorescent properties of RNA Mango are therefore expected to simplify the study of RNA complexes.},

Although some mRNAs are compartmentalized in cytoplasmic regions, most mRNAs, such as housekeeping mRNAs or the poly-adenylated mRNA population, are believed to be distributed throughout the cytoplasm [1\textendash{}4]. The general mechanism by which all mRNAs may move, and how this may be related to localization, is unknown. Here, we report a method to visualize single mRNA molecules in living mammalian cells, and we report that, regardless of any specific cytoplasmic distribution, individual mRNA molecules exhibit rapid and directional movements on microtubules. Importantly, the $\beta$-actin mRNA zipcode increased both the frequency and length of these movements, providing a common mechanistic basis for both localized and nonlocalized mRNAs. Disruption of the cytoskeleton with drugs showed that microtubules and microfilaments are involved in the types of mRNA movements we have observed, which included complete immobility and corralled and nonrestricted diffusion. Individual mRNA molecules switched frequently among these movements, suggesting that mRNAs undergo continuous cycles of anchoring, diffusion, and active transport.},

Here we provide a perspective on the classical and newly emerging role of RNA in this process.

Rhodol VoltageFluor-5 (RVF5) is a voltage-sensitive dye with improved 2P cross-section for use in thick tissue or brain samples. RVF5 features a dichlororhodol core with pyrrolidyl substitution at the nitrogen center. In mammalian cells under one-photon (1P) illumination, RVF5 demonstrates high voltage sensitivity (28\% $\Delta$F/F per 100 mV) and improved photostability relative to first-generation voltage sensors. This photostability enables multisite optical recordings from neurons lacking tuberous sclerosis complex 1, Tsc1, in a mouse model of genetic epilepsy. Using RVF5, we show that Tsc1 KO neurons exhibit increased activity relative to wild-type neurons and additionally show that the proportion of active neurons in the network increases with the loss of Tsc1. The high photostability and voltage sensitivity of RVF5 is recapitulated under 2P illumination. Finally, the ability to chemically tune the 2P absorption profile through the use of rhodol scaffolds affords the unique opportunity to image neuronal voltage changes in acutely prepared mouse brain slices using 2P illumination. Stimulation of the mouse hippocampus evoked spiking activity that was readily discerned with bath-applied RVF5, demonstrating the utility of RVF5 and molecular wire-based voltage sensors with 2P-optimized fluorophores for imaging voltage in intact brain tissue.},

These 'FLINC' biosensors use binding-induced changes in protein fluorescence dynamics to translate kinase activities or protein\textendash{}protein interactions into changes in fluorescence fluctuations, which are quantifiable through stochastic optical fluctuation imaging. A protein kinase A (PKA) biosensor allowed us to resolve minute PKA activity microdomains on the plasma membranes of living cells and to uncover the role of clustered anchoring proteins in organizing these activity microdomains. Together, these findings suggest that biochemical activities of the cell are spatially organized into an activity architecture whose structural and functional characteristics can be revealed by these new biosensors.},

The magnitude of a CD exciton couplet (due to the two Trp residues) and the chemical shifts of a Trp H$\epsilon$3 site (shifted upfield by 2.4 ppm due to the EtF stacking geometry) provided near-identical measures of folding. CD melts of representative peptides with the -TW-loop-WT- motif provided the thermodynamic parameters for folding, which reflect enthalpically driven folding at laboratory temperatures with a small $\Delta$Cp for unfolding (+420 J K-1/mol). In the case of Asx-Pro-Xaa-Thr-Gly-Xaa loops, mutations established that the two most important residues in this class of direction-reversing loops are Asx and Gly:\, mutation to alanine is destabilizing by about 6 and 2 kJ/mol, respectively. All indicators of structuring are retained in a minimized 8-residue construct (Ac-WNPATGKW-NH2) with the fold stability reduced to $\Delta$GU278 = -0.7 kJ/mol.

Although p53 is a transcriptional activator that induces myriad target genes, those p53-inducible genes most critical for tumor suppression remain elusive. Here, we leveraged p53 ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with high-throughput sequencing) and RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) data sets to identify new p53 target genes, focusing on the noncoding genome. We identify Neat1, a noncoding RNA (ncRNA) constituent of paraspeckles, as a p53 target gene broadly induced by mouse and human p53 in different cell types and by diverse stress signals. Using fibroblasts derived from Neat1-/- mice, we examined the functional role of Neat1 in the p53 pathway. We found that Neat1 is dispensable for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress. In sharp contrast, Neat1 plays a crucial role in suppressing transformation in response to oncogenic signals. Neat1 deficiency enhances transformation in oncogene-expressing fibroblasts and promotes the development of premalignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) and cystic lesions in KrasG12D-expressing mice. Neat1 loss provokes global changes in gene expression, suggesting a mechanism by which its deficiency promotes neoplasia. Collectively, these findings identify Neat1 as a p53-regulated large intergenic ncRNA (lincRNA) with a key role in suppressing transformation and cancer initiation, providing fundamental new insight into p53-mediated tumor suppression.},

Chlororhodibalamin, when reacted with silver nitrate, is converted into aquorhodibalamin. In the absence of oxygen, chloro- and aquorhodibalamin are readily reduced by sodium borohydride to rhodibalamin s, the corresponding rhodium(I) complex. Addition of methyl iodide or 5'-iodo-5'-deoxyadenosine to rhodibalamin s yields as the major products methylrhodibalamin and 5'-deoxyadenosylrhodibalamin, respectively. The structure of methylrhodibalamin was demonstrated by the synthesis of [14C]methylrhodibalamin, containing the expected radioactive label in stoichiometric proportion. Methylrhodibalamin exhibits a signal for 3 protons in the NMR spectrum at -1.64 ppm, proving the attachment of the methyl group to rhodium. The structure of 5'-deoxyadenosylrhodibalamin is confirmed by its conversion into dicyanorhodibalamin, adenine, and the cyanhydrin of d-erythro-2,3-dihydroxypent-4-enal in the presence of cyanide. The rhodium analogue of cobalamin coenzyme is also obtained when Propionibacterium shermanii is grown in the absence of cobalt with chloro- or aquorhodibalamin as precursors.

  abstract = {Cobalamins are of widespread importance in biology. Both of the cofactors essential for human metabolism, the organocobalamins coenzyme B12 and methylcobalamin, are highly photolabile, as are other alkylcobalamins. The alkynylcobalamin phenylethynylcobalamin (PhEtyCbl) and the arylcobalamin 4-ethylphenylcobalamin (EtPhCbl) with ``atypical'' Co\textendash{}C-bonds to unsaturated carbons, were recently designed as metabolically inert cobalamins, classified as ``antivitamins B12''. The further development of an ideal light-activated or ``conditional'' antivitamin B12 would require it to be readily converted by light into an active B12 vitamin form. Very photolabile ``antivitamins B12'' would also represent particularly useful scaffolds for therapeutic light-activated reagents. Here, the photoactive arylcobalamin EtPhCbl and the remarkably photostable alkynylcobalamin PhEtyCbl are examined using femtosecond to picosecond UV\textendash{}visible transient absorption spectroscopy. PhEtyCbl undergoes internal conversion to the ground state with near unit quantum yield on a time scale $<$ 100 ps and an activation energy of 12.6 $\pm$ 1.4 kJ/mol. The arylcobalamin EtPhCbl forms an excited state with a ca. 247 ps lifetime. This excited state branches between internal conversion to the ground state and formation of a long-lived base-off species with a quantum yield of $\sim$9\%. Anaerobic steady state photolysis of ``light-sensitive'' EtPhCbl results in the formation of cob(II)alamin, but only with quantum yield $<$1\%. Hence, our studies suggest that suitably modified arylcobalamins may be a rational basis for the design of photoresponsive ``antivitamins B12''.},

Using molecular beacons to track single mRNA molecules in living cells, we have characterized the diffusion of mRNP complexes in the nucleus. The mRNP complexes move freely by Brownian diffusion at a rate that assures their dispersion throughout the nucleus before they exit into the cytoplasm, even when the transcription site is located near the nuclear periphery. The diffusion of mRNP complexes is restricted to the extranucleolar, interchromatin spaces. When mRNP complexes wander into dense chromatin, they tend to become stalled. Although the movement of mRNP complexes occurs without the expenditure of metabolic energy, ATP is required for the complexes to resume their motion after they become stalled. This finding provides an explanation for a number of observations in which mRNA transport appeared to be an enzymatically facilitated process.},

The discovery of extensive transcription of large RNA transcripts that do not code for proteins, termed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), provides an important new perspective on the centrality of RNA in gene regulation. Here, we discuss genome-scale strategies to discover and characterize lncRNAs. An emerging theme from multiple model systems is that lncRNAs form extensive networks of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes with numerous chromatin regulators and then target these enzymatic activities to appropriate locations in the genome. Consistent with this notion, lncRNAs can function as modular scaffolds to specify higher-order organization in RNP complexes and in chromatin states. The importance of these modes of regulation is underscored by the newly recognized roles of long RNAs for proper gene control across all kingdoms of life.},

This study focused only on the effect of binding with TCII. To decrease the possibility of steric problems in binding of the cobalamin conjugates with TCII, and biotin's binding with streptavidin or avidin, moieties of 11-18 atoms in length were used as linkers. Four biotin conjugates were prepared which were attached to the corrin ring of the cobalamin molecule (on b-, c-, d-, and e-side chains). One conjugate was attached to the 5`-OH of the ribose moiety, and another conjugate was attached at the cobalt metal (in place of the cyanide moiety of cyanocobalamin). Competitive binding studies were conducted where various amounts of the cobalamin-biotin conjugates and their precursor cobalamin derivatives competed with [57Co]cyanocobalamin for binding of recombinant human TCII (rhTCII). Evaluation of cobalamin derivatives which were conjugated at the 5`-OH of ribose or the cobalt metal center indicated that conjugation at either of these positions had little effect on binding with rhTCII. However, conjugates where the attachment was made on the corrin ring substituents had a large variation in binding with rhTCII. Conjugates on the e-propionamide side chain had little effect (relative affinity was equal to or decreased less than a factor of 3) on binding with rhTCII, conjugates of the b-isomer had decreased binding (relative affinity decreased less than a factor of 10), conjugates of the d-propionamide had further decreased binding (relative affinity decreased between 44 and 69 times), and conjugates on the c-acetamide group had poor binding to rhTCII (relative affinity decreased between 295 and 1160 times). The significance of the side chains on the corrin ring in providing specificity and high-affinity binding with rhTCII is discussed.},

Two different aptamers, named ZT-26 and ZT-324, were identified by this method and compared to the fluorescence-signaling properties of Spinach, a previously reported RNA aptamer. Aptamer ZT-26 exhibits significantly enhanced fluorescence over Spinach only in vitro. However, aptamer ZT-324 is 36 \% brighter than Spinach when expressed in E. coli. The FACS-based selection strategy presented here is attractive for deriving fluorescent RNA aptamers that function in cells as it directly selects for cells with a high level of fluorescence due to the expression of the RNA aptamer.},

  abstract = {Genetically encodable RNA devices that directly detect small molecules in the cellular environment are of increasing interest for a variety of applications including live cell imaging and synthetic biology. Riboswitches are naturally occurring sensors of intracellular metabolites, primarily found in the bacterial mRNA leaders and regulating their expression. These regulatory elements are generally composed of two domains: an aptamer that binds a specific effector molecule and an expression platform that informs the transcriptional or translational machinery. While it was long established that riboswitch aptamers are modular and portable, capable of directing different output domains including ribozymes, switches, and fluorophore-binding modules, the same has not been demonstrated until recently for expression platforms. We have engineered and validated a set of expression platforms that regulate transcription through a secondary structural switch that can host a variety of different aptamers, including those derived through in vitro selection methods, to create novel chimeric riboswitches. These synthetic switches are capable of a highly specific regulatory response both in vitro and in vivo. Here we present the methodology for the design and engineering of chimeric switches using biological expression platforms.},

Thanks to their unique characteristics and chemical structure, aptamers offer themselves as ideal candidates for use in analytical devices and techniques. Recent progress in the aptamer selection and incorporation of aptamers into molecular beacon structures will ensure the application of aptamers for functional and quantitative proteomics and high-throughput screening for drug discovery, as well as in various analytical applications. The properties of aptamers as well as recent developments in improved, time-efficient methods for their selection and stabilization are outlined. The use of these powerful molecular tools for analysis and the advantages they offer over existing affinity biocomponents are discussed. Finally the evolving use of aptamers in specific analytical applications such as chromatography, ELISA-type assays, biosensors and affinity PCR as well as current avenues of research and future perspectives conclude this review.},

Also, aptamer secondary structures can be engineered to undergo analyte-dependent conformational changes, which, in concert with the ability to specifically place chemical agents, opens up a wealth of possible signal transduction schemas, irrespective of whether the detection modality is optical, electrochemical, or mass based. Finally, because aptamers are nucleic acids, they are readily adapted to sequence- (and hence signal-) amplification methods.

It remains largely unknown, however, how these modifications dynamically change in individual cells. By using fluorescently labeled specific antigen binding fragments (Fabs), we have developed a general method to monitor the distribution and global level of endogenous histone H3 lysine modifications in living cells without disturbing cell growth and embryo development. Fabs produce distinct nuclear patterns that are characteristic of their target modifications. H3K27 trimethylation-specific Fabs, for example, are concentrated on inactive X chromosomes. As Fabs bind their targets transiently, the ratio of bound and free molecules depends on the target concentration, allowing us to measure changes in global modification levels. High-affinity Fabs are suitable for mouse embryo imaging, so we have used them to monitor H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation levels in mouse preimplantation embryos produced by in vitro fertilization and somatic cell nuclear transfer. The data suggest that a high level of H3K27 acetylation is important for normal embryo development. As Fab-based live endogenous modification labeling (FabLEM) is broadly useful for visualizing any modification, it should be a powerful tool for studying cell signaling and diagnosis in the future.},

We describe and characterize an exceptionally rapid and simple new technique for loading large numbers of cultured cells with large macromolecules.

Glass beads (75\textendash{}500 micron diameter) are then sprinkled onto the cells, the cells are washed free of beads and exogenous macromolecules, and `bead-loading' is completed. The conditions for bead-loading can readily be modified to accommodate cell type and loading objectives: for example, the amount of loading per cell increases if bead size is increased or if beads are agitated after sprinkling onto the monolayer, but at the expense of increased cell loss. As many as 97\% of a population of bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells were loaded with a 10,000 Mr dextran; and 79\% with a 150,000 Mr dextran using bead-loading. Various cell lines have been loaded using glass beads. Moreover, bead-loading has the advantage of producing loaded cells that remain adherent and well-spread, thus minimizing recovery time and permitting immediate microscopic examination.},

Genetically encoded self-labeling tag proteins can be coupled to synthetic dyes inside living cells, resulting in brighter reporters than fluorescent proteins. Intracellular labeling using these techniques requires cell-permeable fluorescent ligands, however, limiting utility to a small number of classic fluorophores. Here we describe a simple structural modification that improves the brightness and photostability of dyes while preserving spectral properties and cell permeability. Inspired by molecular modeling, we replaced the N,N-dimethylamino substituents in tetramethylrhodamine with four-membered azetidine rings. This addition of two carbon atoms doubles the quantum efficiency and improves the photon yield of the dye in applications ranging from in vitro single-molecule measurements to super-resolution imaging. The novel substitution is generalizable, yielding a palette of chemical dyes with improved quantum efficiencies that spans the UV and visible range.},

Among their functions, non-coding RNAs are thought to act either as guide or scaffold for epigenetic modifiers that write, erase and read the epigenetic signature over the genome. Studies on human disorders caused by defects in epigenetic modifiers and involving neurological phenotypes highlight the disruption of diverse classes of non-coding RNAs.

Although the aptamer\textendash{}fluorogen system is sufficient for imaging highly abundant non-coding RNAs (tRNAs, rRNAs, etc.), it performs poorly for mRNA imaging due to low brightness. In addition, whether the aptamer-fluorogen system may perturb the native RNA characteristics has not been systematically characterized at the levels of RNA transcription, translation and degradation. To increase the brightness of these aptamer-fluorogen systems, we constructed and tested tandem arrays containing multiple Spinach aptamers (8\textendash{}64 aptamer repeats). Such arrays enhanced the brightness of the tagged mRNA molecules by up to \textasciitilde{}17 fold in living cells. Strong laser excitation with pulsed illumination further increased the imaging sensitivity of Spinach array-tagged RNAs. Moreover, transcriptional fusion to the Spinach array did not affect mRNA transcription, translation or degradation, indicating that aptamer arrays might be a generalizable labeling method for high-performance and low-perturbation live cell RNA imaging.},

Because the initiation factor TFIIB binds to the dock domain and exit tunnel, exiting RNA may prevent TFIIB reassociation during elongation.

The macroscopic diffusion coefficient of mRNA (DMACRO) at the leading edge was 0.3~$\mu$m2/s. On the other hand, DMACRO in the perinuclear region was 0.02~$\mu$m2/s. The destruction of microfilaments with cytochalasin D, which is known to delocalize $\beta$-actin mRNAs, led to an increase in DMACRO to 0.2~$\mu$m2/s in the perinuclear region.

The ribosome translates the information contained within messenger RNAs (mRNAs) into proteins. When and where ribosomes encounter mRNAs can regulate gene expression. Halstead et al. developed an RNA biosensor that allows single molecules of mRNAs that have never been translated to be distinguished from ones that have undergone translation by the ribosome in living cells (see the Perspective by Popp and Maquat). The authors demonstrated the utility of their technique by examining the spatial and temporal regulation of translation in single cells and in Drosophila oocytes during development.
Science, this issue p. 1367; see also p. 1316
Analysis of single molecules in living cells has provided quantitative insights into the kinetics of fundamental biological processes; however, the dynamics of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation have yet to be addressed. We have developed a fluorescence microscopy technique that reports on the first translation events of individual mRNA molecules. This allowed us to examine the spatiotemporal regulation of translation during normal growth and stress and during Drosophila oocyte development. We have shown that mRNAs are not translated in the nucleus but translate within minutes after export, that sequestration within P-bodies regulates translation, and that oskar mRNA is not translated until it reaches the posterior pole of the oocyte. This methodology provides a framework for studying initiation of protein synthesis on single mRNAs in living cells.

In this study, we demonstrate that specific recognition of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by RNA-binding proteins requires the correct spatial positioning of these sequences. We characterized both the cis-acting sequence elements and the spatial restraints that define the mode of RNA binding of the zipcode-binding protein 1 (ZBP1/IMP1/IGF2BP1) to the $\beta$-actin zipcode. The third and fourth KH (hnRNP K homology) domains of ZBP1 specifically recognize a bipartite RNA element comprised of a 5${'}$ element (CGGAC) followed by a variable 3${'}$ element (C/A-CA-C/U) that must be appropriately spaced. Remarkably, the orientation of these elements is interchangeable within target transcripts bound by ZBP1. The spatial relationship of this consensus binding site identified conserved transcripts that were verified to associate with ZBP1 in vivo. The dendritic localization of one of these transcripts, spinophilin, was found to be dependent on both ZBP1 and the RNA elements recognized by ZBP1 KH34.},

Stress granules are mRNA-protein granules that form when translation initiation is limited, and they are related to pathological granules in various neurodegenerative diseases. Super-resolution microscopy reveals stable substructures, referred to as cores, within stress granules that can be purified. Proteomic analysis of stress granule cores reveals a dense network of protein-protein interactions and links between stress granules and human diseases and identifies ATP-dependent helicases and protein remodelers as~conserved stress granule components. ATP is required for stress granule assembly and dynamics. Moreover, multiple ATP-driven machines affect stress granules differently, with the CCT complex inhibiting stress granule assembly, while the MCM and RVB complexes promote stress granule persistence. Our observations suggest that stress granules contain a stable core structure surrounded by a dynamic shell with assembly, disassembly, and transitions between the core and shell modulated by numerous protein and RNA remodeling complexes.},

Mutations focused on improvement of the direction-reversing loop and the addition of favorable Coulombic interactions at the sequence termini. The loop optimization was based on a database search for residues that occur with the greatest probability in similar hairpin loops in proteins. This search suggested replacing the native DDATKT sequence with NPATGK, which resulted in a 4.5 kJ/mol stabilization of the hairpin fold. The introduction of positively charged lysines at the N-terminus provided an additional 2.4 kJ/mol of stabilization, affording a GB1p mutant that is 86 $\pm$ 3\% folded at 25 $^\circ$C with a melting temperature of 60 $\pm$ 2 $^\circ$C. The trpzip version of this peptide, in which three of the hydrophobic core residues were mutated to tryptophan, yielded a sequence that melted at 85 $^\circ$C. Throughout, fold populations and melting temperatures were derived from the mutation and temperature dependence of proton chemical shifts and were corroborated by circular dichroism (CD) melts. The study also suggests that the wild-type GB1p sequence is significantly less stable than reported in some other studies:\, only 30\% folded in water at 25 $^\circ$C.},

  abstract = {Gene expression originates from individual DNA molecules within living cells. Like many single-molecule processes, gene expression and regulation are stochastic, that is, sporadic in time. This leads to heterogeneity in the messenger-RNA and protein copy numbers in a population of cells with identical genomes. With advanced single-cell fluorescence microscopy, it is now possible to quantify transcriptomes and proteomes with single-molecule sensitivity. Dynamic processes such as transcription-factor binding, transcription and translation can be monitored in real time, providing quantitative descriptions of the central dogma of molecular biology and the demonstration that a stochastic single-molecule event can determine the phenotype of a cell.},

However, for short-lived mRNAs, the tight binding of the MS2 coat protein (MCP) to the MS2 binding sites (MBS) protects the RNA from being efficiently degraded, and this confounds the study of mRNA regulation. Here, we describe a reporter system (MBSV6) with reduced affinity for the MCP, which allows mRNA degradation while preserving single-molecule detection determined by single-molecule FISH (smFISH) or live imaging. Constitutive mRNAs (MDN1 and DOA1) and highly-regulated mRNAs (GAL1 and ASH1) endogenously tagged with MBSV6 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae degrade normally. As a result, short-lived mRNAs were imaged throughout their complete life cycle. The MBSV6 reporter revealed that, in contrast to previous findings, coordinated recruitment of mRNAs at specialized structures such as P-bodies during stress did not occur, and mRNA degradation was heterogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm.},

Depletion of SNHG5 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro and limits tumour outgrowth in vivo, whereas SNHG5 overexpression counteracts oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis. Using an unbiased approach, we identify 121 transcript sites interacting with SNHG5 in the cytoplasm. Importantly, knockdown of key SNHG5 target transcripts, including SPATS2, induces apoptosis and thus mimics the effect seen following SNHG5 depletion. Mechanistically, we suggest that SNHG5 stabilizes the target transcripts by blocking their degradation by STAU1. Accordingly, depletion of STAU1 rescues the apoptosis induced after SNHG5 knockdown. Hence, we characterize SNHG5 as a lncRNA promoting tumour cell survival in colorectal cancer and delineate a novel mechanism in which a cytoplasmic lncRNA functions through blocking the action of STAU1.},

While several studies have demonstrated compelling biological and disease roles for individual examples, analytical and experimental approaches to investigate these genes have been hampered by the lack of comprehensive lncRNA annotation. Here, we present and analyze the most complete human lncRNA annotation to date, produced by the GENCODE consortium within the framework of the ENCODE project and comprising 9277 manually annotated genes producing 14,880 transcripts. Our analyses indicate that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding genes, with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing signals, and exon/intron lengths. In contrast to protein-coding genes, however, lncRNAs display a striking bias toward two-exon transcripts, they are predominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleus, and a fraction appear to be preferentially processed into small RNAs. They are under stronger selective pressure than neutrally evolving sequences\textemdash{}particularly in their promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding genes. Importantly, about one-third seem to have arisen within the primate lineage. Comprehensive analysis of their expression in multiple human organs and brain regions shows that lncRNAs are generally lower expressed than protein-coding genes, and display more tissue-specific expression patterns, with a large fraction of tissue-specific lncRNAs expressed in the brain. Expression correlation analysis indicates that lncRNAs show particularly striking positive correlation with the expression of antisense coding genes. This GENCODE annotation represents a valuable resource for future studies of lncRNAs.},

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the long non-coding RNA, SNHG5 on imatinib resistance in CML and explored the underlying mechanisms. The quantitative real-time PCR results showed that SNHG5 and ABCC2 expressions were up-regulated in the isolated peripheral blood cells of the CML patients when compared with healthy controls, and SNHG5 expression levels was positively correlated with ABCC2 in CML patients. In vitro studies showed that the expressions of SNHG5 and ABCC2 were up-regulated in imatinib resistant cells (K562-R) when compared to K562 cells. Bioinformatics analysis showed the interaction between SNHG5 and miR-205-5p, which was further confirmed by luciferase reporter assay and RNA immune-precipitation in K562 cells. Overexpression of SNHG5 suppressed the expression of miR-205-5p and the expression of SNHG5 was negatively correlated with the miR-205-5p expression in CML patients. In addition, ABCC2 was predicted as a downstream target of miR-205-5p, which was further confirmed by the luciferase reporter assay in K562-R cells, and overexpression of miR-205-5p suppressed the expression of ABCC2 in K562-R cells. In vitro functional assay showed that overexpression of SNHG5 in K562 cells increased imatinib resistance and knock-down of SNHG5 reduced the imatinib resistance in K562-R cells. Further experiments showed that SNHG5 promotes imatinib resistance through regulating ABCC2. Taken together, SNHG5 promotes imatinib resistance in CML via acting as a competing endogenous RNA against miR-205-5p.},

Results showed that the levels of SNHG5 and SOX2 were significantly downregulated in OA tissues, while the level of miR-26a was upregulated. MTT, colony formation and cell transwell assays were performed to assess the function of SNHG5 on the cell viability, growth ability, and migration capacity in CHON-001 cells. It was found that SNHG5 could promote chondrocyte cell proliferation and migration. The relationship between SNHG5 and miR-26a was confirmed by RIP and the luciferase reporter assays.

Loss-of-function assays were performed to examine the effects of silenced SNHG6 on the progression of osteosarcoma, indicating that silenced SNHG6 suppressed cell proliferation through inducing cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and causing cell apoptosis. In vitro assays exposed the potential oncogenic role of SNHG6 in osteosarcoma, further affirmed by in vivo nude mice assays. Mechanistic assays demonstrated that SNHG6 was negatively correlated with p21 and KLF2 in osteosarcoma.

However, these findings remain controversial, and the overall proportion of cytoplasmic lncRNAs involved is unknown. Here we make a global, absolute estimate of the cytoplasmic and ribosome-associated population of stringently filtered lncRNAs in a human cell line using polysome profiling coupled to spike-in normalized microarray analysis. Fifty-four percent of expressed lncRNAs are detected in the cytoplasm. The majority of these (70\%) have $>$50\% of their cytoplasmic copies associated with polysomal fractions. These interactions are lost upon disruption of ribosomes by puromycin. Polysomal lncRNAs are distinguished by a number of 5${'}$ mRNA-like features, including capping and 5${'}$UTR length. On the other hand, nonpolysomal ``free cytoplasmic'' lncRNAs have more conserved promoters and a wider range of expression across cell types. Exons of polysomal lncRNAs are depleted of endogenous retroviral insertions, suggesting a role for repetitive elements in lncRNA localization. Finally, we show that blocking of ribosomal elongation results in stabilization of many associated lncRNAs. Together these findings suggest that the ribosome is the default destination for the majority of cytoplasmic long noncoding RNAs and may play a role in their degradation.},

In the present study, a panel of SNHGs was profiled to detect aberrantly expressed SNHGs in gastric cancer (GC). The expression of SNHG5 was significantly downregulated in GC and was significantly associated with the formation of a tumor embolus and with the tumor, node and metastasis stage. SNHG5 was a long non-coding RNA, which was a class of non-coding RNA transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides. SNHG5 suppressed GC cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, SNHG5 exerted its function through interacting with MTA2, preventing the translocation of MTA2 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. SNHG5 overexpression led to significant increases in the acetylation levels of histone H3 and p53, indicating that SNHG5 might affect acetylation by trapping MTA2 in the cytosol, thereby interfering with the formation of the nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation complex. This study is the first to demonstrate that SNHG5 is a critical and powerful regulator that is involved in GC progression through trapping MTA2 in the cytosol. These results imply that SNHG5 may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of GC.},

Most snoRNAs so far characterized are encoded and processed from introns of premRNAs. Results We found a novel intronic snoRNA gene, named U50HG, located on chromosome 6q15, at the breakpoint of chromosomal translocation t(3;6)(q27;q15). The U50HG gene is composed of six exons, whose spliced transcripts have little potential for coding a protein, and its introns produce both U50 and U50?like (U50?) snoRNAs that are localized in nucleoli. It possesses an oligopyrimidine tract that is characteristic of the 5??terminal oligopyrimidine (5?TOP) class of genes which have been shown to be coordinately regulated in response to cell growth. Conclusions U50HG is a member of the nonprotein?coding multiple snoRNA host gene family, as well as of the 5?TOP gene family similar to UHG (U22 host gene), U17HG (U17 host gene), U19HG (U19 host gene) and gas5 (growth arrest?specific transcript 5 gene).

When applied to the neurotransmitter precursors 5-hydroxytryptophan and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, this approach yielded easily identifiable and characterizable aptamers predisposed for coupling to readout domains to allow engineering of nucleic acid\textendash{}sensory devices that function in vitro and in the cellular context.},

  abstract = {Summary
Stress granules are mRNA-protein assemblies formed from nontranslating mRNAs. Stress granules are important in the stress response and may contribute to some degenerative diseases. Here, we describe the stress granule transcriptome of~yeast and mammalian cells through RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of purified stress granule cores and single-molecule fluorescence in~situ hybridization (smFISH) validation. While essentially every mRNA, and some noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), can be targeted to stress granules, the targeting efficiency varies from $<$1\% to $>$95\%. mRNA accumulation in stress granules correlates with longer coding and UTR regions and poor translatability. Quantifying the RNA-seq analysis by smFISH reveals that only 10\% of bulk mRNA molecules accumulate in mammalian stress granules and that only 185 genes have more than 50\% of their~mRNA molecules in stress granules. These results suggest that stress granules may not represent a specific biological program of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) assembly, but instead form by condensation of nontranslating mRNPs in proportion to their length and lack of association with ribosomes.},

Cajal bodies are nuclear structures that are involved in biogenesis of snRNPs and snoRNPs, maintenance of telomeres and processing of histone mRNA. Recently, the SUMO isopeptidase USPL1 was identified as a component of Cajal bodies that is essential for cellular growth and Cajal body integrity. However, a cellular function for USPL1 is so far unknown. Here, we use RNAi-mediated knockdown in human cells in combination with biochemical and fluorescence microscopy approaches to investigate the function of USPL1 and its link to Cajal bodies. We demonstrate that levels of snRNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase (RNAP) II are reduced upon knockdown of USPL1 and that downstream processes such as snRNP assembly and pre-mRNA splicing are compromised. Importantly, we find that USPL1 associates directly with U snRNA loci and that it interacts and colocalises with components of the Little Elongation Complex, which is involved in RNAPII-mediated snRNA transcription. Thus, our data indicate that USPL1 plays a key role in RNAPII-mediated snRNA transcription.},

To elucidate how this small aptamer exhibits such properties, which make it well suited for studying low-copy cellular RNAs, we determined its 1.7-\AA-resolution co-crystal structure. Unexpectedly, the entire ligand, including TO, biotin and the linker connecting them, abuts one of the near-planar faces of the three-tiered G-quadruplex. The two heterocycles of TO are held in place by two loop adenines and form a 45$^\circ$ angle with respect to each other. Minimizing this angle would increase quantum yield and further improve this tool for in vivo RNA visualization.},

To elucidate the molecular basis of Spinach fluorescence, we solved the cocrystal structure of Spinach bound to its cognate exogenous chromophore, showing that Spinach activates the small molecule by immobilizing it between a base triple, a G-quadruplex and an unpaired G. Mutational and NMR analyses indicate that the G-quadruplex is essential for Spinach fluorescence, is also present in other fluorogenic RNAs and may represent a general strategy for RNAs to induce fluorescence of chromophores.

  abstract = {The effective tracking and purification of biological RNAs and RNA protein complexes is currently challenging. One promising strategy to simultaneously address both of these problems is to develop high-affinity RNA aptamers against taggable small molecule fluorophores. RNA Mango is a 39-nucleotide, parallel-stranded G-quadruplex RNA aptamer motif that binds with nanomolar affinity to a set of thiazole orange (TO1) derivatives while simultaneously inducing a 103-fold increase in fluorescence. We find that RNA Mango has a large increase in its thermal stability upon the addition of its TO1-Biotin ligand. Consistent with this thermal stabilization, RNA Mango can effectively discriminate TO1-Biotin from a broad range of small molecule fluorophores. In contrast, RNA Spinach, which is known to have a substantially more rigid G-quadruplex structure, was found to bind to this set of fluorophores, often with higher affinity than to its native ligand, 3,5-difluoro-4-hydroxybenzylidene imidazolinone (DFHBI), and did not exhibit thermal stabilization in the presence of the TO1-Biotin fluorophore. Our data suggest that RNA Mango is likely to use a concerted ligand-binding mechanism that allows it to simultaneously bind and recognize its TO1-Biotin ligand, whereas RNA Spinach appears to lack such a mechanism. The high binding affinity and fluorescent efficiency of RNA Mango provides a compelling alternative to RNA Spinach as an RNA reporter system and paves the way for the future development of small fluorophore RNA reporter systems.},

During SMD, STAU1, a double?stranded (ds) RNA?binding protein, recognizes dsRNA structures formed either by intramolecular base pairing of 3??UTR sequences or by intermolecular base pairing of 3??UTR sequences with a long?noncoding RNA (lncRNA) via partially complementary Alu elements. Recently, STAU2, a paralog of STAU1, has also been reported to mediate SMD. Both STAU1 and STAU2 interact directly with the ATP?dependent RNA helicase UPF1, a key SMD factor, enhancing its helicase activity to promote effective SMD. Moreover, STAU1 and STAU2 form homodimeric and heterodimeric interactions via domain?swapping. Because both SMD and the mechanistically related nonsense?mediated mRNA decay (NMD) employ UPF1; SMD and NMD are competitive pathways. Competition contributes to cellular differentiation processes, such as myogenesis and adipogenesis, placing SMD at the heart of various physiologically important mechanisms.

Moreover, suboptimal chemical properties, such as the potential to isomerize, have hindered efforts to improve ciliobrevins. Here, we characterized the structure of ciliobrevins and designed conformationally-constrained isosteres. We identified dynapyrazoles, inhibitors more potent than ciliobrevins in vitro, and find that while ciliobrevins inhibit both dynein's microtubule-stimulated and basal ATPase activity, dynapyrazoles block only microtubule-stimulated activity. Single-digit micromolar concentrations of dynapyrazoles block intraflagellar transport in the cilium and lysosome motility in the cytoplasm, processes that depend on cytoplasmic dyneins. Together, our studies suggest that chemical structure-based analyses can lead to inhibitors with distinct modes of inhibition and improved properties.},

  abstract = {Copper is a required metal nutrient for life, but global or local alterations in its homeostasis are linked to diseases spanning genetic and metabolic disorders to cancer and neurodegeneration. Technologies that enable longitudinal in vivo monitoring of dynamic copper pools can help meet the need to study the complex interplay between copper status, health, and disease in the same living organism over time. Here, we present the synthesis, characterization, and in vivo imaging applications of Copper-Caged Luciferin-1 (CCL-1), a bioluminescent reporter for tissue-specific copper visualization in living animals. CCL-1 uses a selective copper(I)-dependent oxidative cleavage reaction to release d-luciferin for subsequent bioluminescent reaction with firefly luciferase. The probe can detect physiological changes in labile Cu(+) levels in live cells and mice under situations of copper deficiency or overload. Application of CCL-1 to mice with liver-specific luciferase expression in a diet-induced model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease reveals onset of hepatic copper deficiency and altered expression levels of central copper trafficking proteins that accompany symptoms of glucose intolerance and weight gain. The data connect copper dysregulation to metabolic liver disease and provide a starting point for expanding the toolbox of reactivity-based chemical reporters for cell- and tissue-specific in vivo imaging.},

  abstract = {Manipulation of neuronal activity through genetically targeted actuator molecules is a powerful approach for studying information flow in the brain. In these approaches the genetically targeted component, a receptor or a channel, is activated either by a small molecule (chemical genetics) or by light from a physical source (optogenetics). We developed a hybrid technology that allows control of the same neurons by both optogenetic and chemical genetic means. The approach is based on engineered chimeric fusions of a light-generating protein (luciferase) to a light-activated ion channel (channelrhodopsin). Ionic currents then can be activated by bioluminescence upon activation of luciferase by its substrate, coelenterazine (CTZ), as well as by external light. In cell lines, expression of the fusion of Gaussia luciferase to Channelrhodopsin-2 yielded photocurrents in response to CTZ. Larger photocurrents were produced by fusing the luciferase to Volvox Channelrhodopsin-1. This version allowed chemical modulation of neuronal activity when expressed in cultured neurons: CTZ treatment shifted neuronal responses to injected currents and sensitized neurons to fire action potentials in response to subthreshold synaptic inputs. These luminescent channelrhodopsins--or luminopsins--preserve the advantages of light-activated ion channels, while extending their capabilities. Our proof-of-principle results suggest that this novel class of tools can be improved and extended in numerous ways.},

  volume = {135},
  doi = {10.1021/ja309078t},
  abstract = {In vivo molecular imaging holds promise for understanding the underlying mechanisms of health, injury, aging, and disease, as it can detect distinct biochemical processes such as enzymatic activity, reactive small-molecule fluxes, or post-translational modifications. Current imaging techniques often detect only a single biochemical process, but, within whole organisms, multiple types of biochemical events contribute to physiological and pathological phenotypes. In this report, we present a general strategy for dual-analyte detection in living animals that employs in situ formation of firefly luciferin from two complementary caged precursors that can be unmasked by different biochemical processes. To establish this approach, we have developed Peroxy Caged Luciferin-2 (PCL-2), a H(2)O(2)-responsive boronic acid probe that releases 6-hydroxy-2-cyanobenzothiazole (HCBT) upon reacting with this reactive oxygen species, as well as a peptide-based probe, z-Ile-Glu-ThrAsp-D-Cys (IETDC), which releases D-cysteine in the presence of active caspase 8. Once released, HCBT and D-cysteine form firefly luciferin in situ, giving rise to a bioluminescent signal if and only if both chemical triggers proceed. This system thus constitutes an AND-type molecular logic gate that reports on the simultaneous presence of H(2)O(2) and caspase 8 activity. Using these probes, chemoselective imaging of either H(2)O(2) or caspase 8 activity was performed in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, concomitant use of PCL-2 and IETDC in vivo establishes a concurrent increase in both H(2)O(2) and caspase 8 activity during acute inflammation in living mice. Taken together, this method offers a potentially powerful new chemical tool for studying simultaneous oxidative stress and inflammation processes in living animals during injury, aging, and disease, as well as a versatile approach for concurrent monitoring of multiple analytes using luciferin-based bioluminescence imaging technologies.},

  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1418468112},
  abstract = {Fluorescence live imaging has become an essential methodology in modern cell biology. However, fluorescence requires excitation light, which can sometimes cause potential problems, such as autofluorescence, phototoxicity, and photobleaching. Furthermore, combined with recent optogenetic tools, the light illumination can trigger their unintended activation. Because luminescence imaging does not require excitation light, it is a good candidate as an alternative imaging modality to circumvent these problems. The application of luminescence imaging, however, has been limited by the two drawbacks of existing luminescent protein probes, such as luciferases: namely, low brightness and poor color variants. Here, we report the development of bright cyan and orange luminescent proteins by extending our previous development of the bright yellowish-green luminescent protein Nano-lantern. The color change and the enhancement of brightness were both achieved by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) from enhanced Renilla luciferase to a fluorescent protein. The brightness of these cyan and orange Nano-lanterns was $\sim$20 times brighter than wild-type Renilla luciferase, which allowed us to perform multicolor live imaging of intracellular submicron structures. The rapid dynamics of endosomes and peroxisomes were visualized at around 1-s temporal resolution, and the slow dynamics of focal adhesions were continuously imaged for longer than a few hours without photobleaching or photodamage. In addition, we extended the application of these multicolor Nano-lanterns to simultaneous monitoring of multiple gene expression or Ca(2+) dynamics in different cellular compartments in a single cell.},

  volume = {6},
  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0019277},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Despite a plethora of bioluminescent reporter genes being cloned and used for cell assays and molecular imaging purposes, the simultaneous monitoring of multiple events in small animals is still challenging. This is partly attributable to the lack of optimization of cell reporter gene expression as well as too much spectral overlap of the color-coupled reporter genes. A new red emitting codon-optimized luciferase reporter gene mutant of Photinus pyralis, Ppy RE8, has been developed and used in combination with the green click beetle luciferase, CBG99.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were transfected with vectors that expressed red Ppy RE8 and green CBG99 luciferases. Populations of red and green emitting cells were mixed in different ratios. After addition of the shared single substrate, D-luciferin, bioluminescent (BL) signals were imaged with an ultrasensitive cooled CCD camera using a series of band pass filters (20 nm). Spectral unmixing algorithms were applied to the images where good separation of signals was observed. Furthermore, HEK293 cells that expressed the two luciferases were injected at different depth in the animals. Spectrally-separate images and quantification of the dual BL signals in a mixed population of cells was achieved when cells were either injected subcutaneously or directly into the prostate.

SIGNIFICANCE:We report here the re-engineering of different luciferase genes for in vitro and in vivo dual color imaging applications to address the technical issues of using dual luciferases for imaging. In respect to previously used dual assays, our study demonstrated enhanced sensitivity combined with spatially separate BL spectral emissions using a suitable spectral unmixing algorithm. This new D-luciferin-dependent reporter gene couplet opens up the possibility in the future for more accurate quantitative gene expression studies in vivo by simultaneously monitoring two events in real time.},

  abstract = {Dengue virus (DENV) is a global disease threat for which there are no approved antivirals or vaccines. Establishing state-of-the-art screening systems that rely on fluorescent or luminescent reporters may accelerate the development of anti-DENV therapeutics. However, relatively few reporter DENV platforms exist. Here, we show that DENV can be genetically engineered to express a green fluorescent protein or firefly luciferase. Reporter viruses are infectious in vitro and in vivo and are sensitive to antiviral compounds, neutralizing antibodies, and interferons. Bioluminescence imaging was used to follow the dynamics of DENV infection in mice and revealed that the virus localized predominantly to lymphoid and gut-associated tissues. The high-throughput potential of reporter DENV was demonstrated by screening a library of more than 350 IFN-stimulated genes for antiviral activity. Several antiviral effectors were identified, and they targeted DENV at two distinct life cycle steps. These viruses provide a powerful platform for applications ranging from validation of vaccine candidates to antiviral discovery.},

  abstract = {Coelenterazine is widely distributed among marine organisms, producing bioluminescence by calcium-insensitive oxidation mediated by Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and calcium-dependent oxidation mediated by the photoprotein aequorin. Despite its abundance in nature and wide use of both proteins as reporters of gene expression and signal transduction, little is known about mechanisms of coelenterazine transport and cell permeation. Interestingly, coelenterazine analogues share structural and physiochemical properties of compounds transported by the multidrug resistance MDR1 P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Herein, we report that living cells stably transfected with a codon-humanized Rluc show coelenterazine-mediated bioluminescence in a highly MDR1 Pgp-modulated manner. In Pgp-expressing Rluc cells, low baseline bioluminescence could be fully enhanced (reversed) to non-Pgp matched control levels with potent and selective Pgp inhibitors. Therefore, using coelenterazine and noninvasive bioluminescence imaging in vivo, we could directly monitor tumor-specific Pgp transport inhibition in living mice. While enabling molecular imaging and high-throughput screening of drug resistance pathways, these data also raise concern for the indiscriminate use of Rluc and aequorin as reporters in intact cells or transgenic animals, wherein Pgp-mediated alterations in coelenterazine permeability may impact results.},

  abstract = {Ca2+ and Zn2+ dynamics have been identified as important drivers of physiological processes. In order for these dynamics to encode function, the cell must have sensors that transduce changes in metal concentration to specific downstream actions. Here we compare and contrast the native metal sensors: calmodulin (CaM), the quintessential Ca2+ sensor and metal-responsive transcription factor 1 (MTF1), a candidate Zn2+ sensor. While CaM recognizes and modulates the activity of hundreds of proteins through allosteric interactions, MTF1 recognizes a single DNA motif that is distributed throughout the genome regulating the transcription of many target genes. We examine how the different inorganic chemistries of these two metal ions may shape these different mechanisms transducing metal ion concentration into changing physiologic activity. In addition to native metal sensors, scientists have engineered sensors to spy on the dynamic changes of metals in cells. The inorganic chemistry of the metals shapes the possibilities in the design strategies of engineered sensors. We examine how different strategies to tune the affinities of engineered sensors mirror the strategies nature developed to sense both Ca2+ and Zn2+ in cells. * CaM, : calmodulin; CaMKII, : CaM-dependent kinase II; FP, : fluorescent protein; MRE, : metal-response element; MTF1, : metal-responsive transcription factor 1; SK, : small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels; smMLCK, : smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase},

The cDNA sequence of L. italica luciferase was determined to be 1647 base pairs in length with an open reading frame of 548 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis of the protein sequence demonstrated that this luciferase is closely related to that of other fireflies of the Lampyridae family, particularly within the Luciolinae subfamily, showing 96\% homology to luciferases from the fireflies Hotaria unmunsana and Hotaria parvula. The specific activity of the L. italica luciferase was 78\% of the North American enzyme, after correction for emission color differences. The bioluminescence emission of the Italian firefly is pH sensitive with maxima at 566 nm and 614 nm at pH 7.8 and 6.0, respectively. Interestingly, the total bioluminescence output was approximately 2-fold greater than that of P. pyralis luciferase due to differences in turnover characteristics evidenced by extended light emission decay kinetics. We expect that this newly discovered luciferase will be suitable for a wide range of bioluminescence applications including in vivo imaging and multiplex assays.},

We used directed evolution to explore allosteric regulation as a source of latent catalytic potential using the $\beta$-subunit of tryptophan synthase from Pyrococcus furiosus (PfTrpB). As part of its native $\alpha\beta\beta\alpha$ complex, TrpB efficiently produces tryptophan and tryptophan analogs; activity drops considerably when it is used as a stand-alone catalyst without the $\alpha$-subunit. Kinetic, spectroscopic, and X-ray crystallographic data show that this lost activity can be recovered by mutations that reproduce the effects of complexation with the $\alpha$-subunit. The engineered PfTrpB is a powerful platform for production of Trp analogs and for further directed evolution to expand substrate and reaction scope.},

  abstract = {The cytoplasmic Myc protein (c-Myc) regulates various human genes and is dysregulated in many human cancers. Phosphorylation mediates the protein activation of c-Myc and is essential for the function of this transcription factor in normal cell behavior and tumor growth. To date, however, the targeting of Myc as a therapeutic approach for cancer treatment has been achieved primarily at the nonprotein level. We have developed a molecular imaging sensor for noninvasive imaging of c-Myc activity in living subjects using a split Firefly luciferase (FL) complementation strategy to detect and quantify the phosphorylation-mediated interaction between glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) and c-Myc. This sensor system consists of two fusion proteins, GSK 35-433-CFL and NFL-c-Myc, in which specific fragments of GSK3beta and c-Myc are fused with C-terminal and N-terminal fragments of the split FL, respectively. The sensor detects phosphorylation-specific GSK3beta-c-Myc interaction, the imaging signal of which correlates with the steady-state and temporal regulation of c-Myc phosphorylation in cell culture. The sensor also detects inhibition of c-Myc activity via differential pathways, allowing noninvasive monitoring of c-Myc-targeted drug efficacy in intact cells and living mice. Notably, this drug inhibition is detected before changes in tumor size are apparent in mouse xenograft and liver tumor models. This reporter system not only provides an innovative way to investigate the role of functional c-Myc in normal and cancer-related biological processes, but also facilitates c-Myc-targeted drug development by providing a rapid quantitative approach to assessing cancer response to therapy in living subjects.},

However, detection and sensing methods are limited, expensive, and/or low-throughput, including MS and antibody based detection. We found that by combining four synthetic receptors developed by dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) in an indicator displacement system, we are able to create a pattern-based sensor platform that can discriminate single PTMs such as methylation and acetylation on a representative histone peptide with 100\% accuracy as well as peptides bearing both dimethyl and trimethyl lysine in the presence of arginine methylation, which has not previously been demonstrated, and can even correctly distinguish the position of lysine methylation individually or in the presence of other PTMs. To extend this approach, a full panel of thirteen analytes containing different combinations of PTMs were classified with 96 $\pm$ 1\% overall accuracy in a 50\% left-out analysis, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the sensor array. Finally, the sensor platform was also used to demonstrate proof of concept for enzymatic assays by analysing the mock reaction of a threonine kinase, successfully identifying analytes representative of substrate conversion both with and without neighboring PTMs. This work provides a rapid platform for the analysis of peptides bearing complex modifications and highlights the utility of receptors discovered though DCC that display variations in binding affinity and selectivity.},

  volume = {25},

  abstract = {Three semi-rational approaches, combinatorial site-saturation mutagenesis (CSSM) using a reduced amino acid set and two libraries based on Corbit and CRAM computational design algorithms targeting up to 10 active site residues, were used to engineer cytochrome P450 BM3 to demethylate dimethyl ether and hydroxylate propane and ethane. These small libraries (343\textendash{}1028 variants) were all enriched with respect to the fraction functional and maximal activities compared with a random mutagenesis library and individual site-saturation libraries targeting the same residues. Despite high average amino acid substitution levels of 2.6, 5 and 7.5, the CSSM, Corbit and CRAM libraries had at least 75\% of library members properly folded. Propane- and ethane-hydroxylating P450 BM3 variants were identified using all three mutagenesis approaches, with as few as two amino acid substitutions. The library designed using the CRAM algorithm, which sought to reduce the size of the binding pocket, produced both a higher number of active variants and variants supporting the greatest number of catalytic turnovers. The most active variant E32 supports 16 800 propane turnovers at 36\% coupling, which rivals the activity of variants obtained after 10\textendash{}12 rounds of directed evolution using random and site-saturation mutagenesis. None of the variants in this study achieved the complete re-specialization for propane hydroxylation (including 93\% coupling) previously obtained via multiple rounds of mutagenesis and screening. However, these semi-rational approaches allowed for large jumps in sequence space to variants with the desired functions.},

It was shown that active site mutations that resulted in spectral shifts of bioluminescence as a rule caused substantial decrease in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. At the same time, mutations in the conservative regions of the protein amino acid sequence that were in the periphery of the protein globe resulted in red shift of the bioluminescence spectra without affecting catalytic activity. Correlation was observed between the value of spectral shift and polarizability of the introduced amino acid residue: the higher the polarizability, the larger was the red shift of bioluminescence.},

Analysis of quenching of tryptophan fluorescence showed that the tryptophan residue conserved in all luciferases is not accessible for charged quenchers, which is explained by the presence of positively and negatively charged amino acid residues in the close vicinity to it. An effective energy transfer from tryptophan to luciferin was observed during quenching of tryptophan fluorescence of both luciferases with luciferin. From the data on the energy transfer, the distance between the luciferin molecule and Trp-417 (419) in the luciferin luciferase complex was calculated: 11-15 A for P. pyralis and 12-17 A for L. mingrelica luciferases.

This molecule comprises a nitroaromatic core that can be selectively reduced ("uncaged") by one cell type, liberating a luciferin that can be selectively consumed by neighboring, luciferase-expressing cells. When the two cell types are in contact, robust light emission is observed. This imaging strategy will enable the noninvasive visualization of cell-cell interactions relevant to organismal biology.},

A library of five residues (Leu25', Arg29', Leu76, Ile80' and Asp83') surrounding pBzF72 was generated and subjected to a growth based selection in a chorismate mutase deficient strain. An EcCM variant (Phe25', pBzF72, Thr76, Gly80' and Tyr83') forms a stable homodimer, has catalytic activity similar to the wild type enzyme, and unfolds with a Tm of 53 $^\circ$C. The X-ray crystal structure reveals a pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions that stabilize the new protein interface. The strategy described here should be useful for generating organisms that are dependent on the presence of a ncAA for growth.},

  volume = {88},

  abstract = {Engineered alphavirus vectors expressing reporters of infection have been used for a number of years due to their relatively low costs for analysis of virus replication and the capacity to utilize imaging systems for longitudinal measurements of growth within single animals. In general, these vectors have been derived from Old World alphaviruses using a second viral subgenomic promoter to express the transgenes, placed either immediately after the nonstructural proteins or at the 3' end of the viral coding sequences. However, the relevance of these vectors to natural infections is questionable, as they have not been rigorously tested for virulence in vivo in comparison with parental viruses or for the retention of the reporter during replication. Here, we report construction of new expression vectors for two Old World arthritogenic alphaviruses (Sindbis and Chikungunya viruses) and two New World encephalitic alphaviruses (eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses) based upon either fusion of the reporter protein in frame within nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) or insertion of the reporter as a cleavable element between the capsid and PE2 structural proteins. We have compared these with a traditional 3' double subgenomic promoter virus expressing either a large, firefly luciferase (fLuc; 1,650 nucleotides), or small, NanoLuc (nLuc; 513 nucleotides), luminescent reporter protein. Results indicate that the nLuc is substantially more stable than fLuc during repeated rounds of infection regardless of the transgene location. However, the capsid-PE2 insertion and nsP3 fusion viruses exhibit the most authentic mimicking of parental virus infection regardless of expressed protein. IMPORTANCE As more antiviral therapeutics and vaccines are developed, rapid and accurate in vivo modeling of their efficacy will be required. However, current alphavirus vectors expressing reporters of infection have not been extensively tested for accurate mimicking of the infection characteristics of unmodified parental viruses. Additionally, use of in vivo imaging systems detecting light emitted from luciferase reporters can significantly decrease costs associated with efficacy studies by minimizing numbers of animals. Herein we report development and testing of new expression vectors for Sindbis, Chikungunya, and eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses and demonstrate that a small ($\sim$500-nucleotide) reporter gene (NanoLuc; Promega) is very stable and causes a disease severity similar to that caused by unmodified parental viruses. In contrast, expression of larger reporters is very rapidly lost with virus replication and can be significantly attenuating. The utility of NanoLuc for in vivo imaging is also demonstrated.},

  abstract = {SummaryNumerous near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent proteins (FPs) were recently engineered from bacterial photoreceptors but lack of their systematic comparison makes researcher's choice rather difficult. Here we evaluated side-by-side several modern NIR FPs, such as blue-shifted smURFP and miRFP670, and red-shifted mIFP and miRFP703. We found that among all NIR FPs, miRFP670 had the highest fluorescence intensity in various mammalian cells. For instance, in common HeLa cells miRFP703, mIFP, and smURFP were 2-, 9-, and 53-fold dimmer than miRFP670. Either co-expression of heme oxygenase or incubation of cells with heme precursor weakly affected NIR fluorescence, however, in the latter case elevated cellular autofluorescence. Exogenously added chromophore substantially increased smURFP brightness but only slightly enhanced brightness of other NIR FPs. mIFP showed intermediate, while monomeric miRFP670 and miRFP703 exhibited high binding efficiency of endogenous biliverdin chromophore. This feature makes them easy to use as GFP-like proteins for spectral multiplexing with FPs of visible range.},

  doi = {10.7554/eLife.10606},
  abstract = {Small molecules play essential roles in organisms, and so methods to sense these molecules within living cells could have wide-ranging uses in both biology and biotechnology. However, current methods for making new ``biosensors'' are limited and only a narrow range of small molecules can be detected. One approach to biosensor design in yeast and other eukaryotic organisms uses proteins called ligand-binding domains, which bind to small molecules. Here, Feng, Jester, Tinberg, Mandell et al. have developed a new method to make biosensors from ligand-binding domains that could, in principle, be applied to any target small molecule. The new method involves taking a ligand-binding domain that is either engineered or occurs in nature and linking it to something that can be readily detected, such as a protein that fluoresces or that controls gene expression. This combined biosensor protein is then engineered, via mutations, such that it is unstable unless it binds to the small molecule. This means that, in the absence of the small molecule, these proteins are destroyed inside living cells. However, the binding of a target molecule to one of these proteins protects it from degradation, which allows the signal to be detected. Feng, Jester, Tinberg, Mandell et al. use this method to create biosensors for a human hormone called progesterone and a drug called digoxin, which is used to treat heart disease. Further experiments used the biosensors to optimize the production of progesterone in yeast and to regulate the activity of a gene editing protein called Cas9 in human cells. The biosensors can be also used to produce long-term environmental sensors in plant cells. This approach makes it possible to produce a wide variety of biosensors for different organisms. The next step is to continue to explore the ability of various proteins to be converted into biosensors, and to find out how easy it is to transfer a biosensor produced in one species to another.},

  abstract = {Cells receive many signals from their environment, for example, when they are compressed or pulled about by neighboring cells. Information about these `mechanical stimuli' can be transmitted within the cell to trigger changes in gene expression and cell behavior. When a cell receives a mechanical stimulus, it can activate the release of calcium ions from storage compartments within the cell, including from a compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum. Calcium ions can also enter the cell from outside via channels located in the membrane that surrounds the cell (the plasma membrane). Kim et al. investigated how mechanical forces are transmitted in a type of human cell called mesenchymal stem cells using optical tweezers to apply a gentle force to the outside of a cell. These tweezers use a laser to attract tiny objects, in this case a bead attached to proteins in the cell's outer membrane. The cell's response to this mechanical stimulation was measured using a sensor protein that fluoresces a different color when it binds to calcium ions. With this set-up, Kim et al. found that mesenchymal stem cells are able to transmit mechanical forces to different depths within the cell. The forces can travel deep to trigger the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum. This process involves a network of protein fibers that criss-cross to support the structure of a cell\textemdash{}called the cytoskeleton\textemdash{}and also requires proteins that are associated with the cytoskeleton to contract. However, calcium ion entry through the plasma membrane due to a mechanical force does not require these contractile proteins\textemdash{}only the cytoskeleton is involved. These results demonstrate that the transmission of mechanical signals to different depths within mesenchymal stem cells involves different components. Future work should shed light on how these mechanical signals control gene expression and the development of mesenchymal stem cells.},

  volume = {355},
  doi = {10.1126/science.aai8386},
  abstract = {INTRODUCTION The microbes that live in and on our bodies (the human microbiome) profoundly affect human health and disease. For example, within the lower gastrointestinal tract, microbes employ powerful enzymatic chemistry to access recalcitrant nutrients and generate metabolites that mediate interactions with host cells. Given the vast amounts of available sequencing data from human microbiomes, we know surprisingly little about the precise mechanisms by which these activities influence human biology. This knowledge gap arises in part from our poor understanding of microbial enzymes and metabolic processes. Collectively, the genes present in microbiomes (metagenomes) encode millions of uncharacterized enzymes, and approaches are needed to connect these genes to biochemical functions.RATIONALE Efforts to identify the microbial activities encoded within metagenomes (functional profiling) have largely focused on assigning protein sequences found in these data sets to overarching processes (e.g., ``vitamin biosynthesis'') or large enzyme superfamilies whose members carry out many different chemical reactions. These methods therefore provide limited information about specific enzymes of interest and cannot easily differentiate superfamily members with known and unknown functions. Addressing this problem requires incorporating a mechanistic understanding of how amino acid sequence influences enzymatic activity into metagenomic analyses. We envisioned developing a ``chemically guided'' functional profiling strategy that would use protein sequence similarity network (SSN) analysis to distinguish functionally distinct members of large enzyme superfamilies and integrate this information into quantitative metagenomics. This method would not only quantify different types of enzymes in metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data sets, but also pinpoint enzymes of unknown function in communities, prioritizing them for further study on the basis of their abundance and distribution. We initially applied this workflow to profile the glycyl radical enzyme (GRE) superfamily, which is one of the most enriched protein families in the human gut microbiome. GREs are O2-sensitive enzymes that catalyze key transformations in anaerobic microbial metabolism, including carbohydrate utilization and DNA synthesis. Although the activities of certain gut microbial GREs have been connected to heart, liver, and kidney diseases, as well as autism, numerous members of this superfamily have not yet been biochemically characterized. RESULTS We determined the abundance of individual types of GREs in 378 metagenomes from healthy humans, including two aerobic body sites (vagina and skin), three microaerobic body sites (tongue, inner cheek, and dental plaque), and one anaerobic body site (gut). The human gut microbiome contained the largest number of distinct GREs, many of which have unknown functions. Our analysis provided new information about known GRE-mediated activities, including production of the disease-associated metabolites trimethylamine and p-cresol. In vitro studies of abundant, uncharacterized GREs from the human gut revealed that radical-based dehydration chemistry is widespread in this environment and led to the discovery of trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline (Hyp) dehydratase. This enzyme enables gut commensals and human pathogens like Clostridium difficile to metabolize Hyp, a nonproteinogenic amino acid that is rare in bacteria but is an abundant posttranslational modification in eukaryotes. The universal distribution of this activity in human gut microbiomes suggests that it plays an important role in this habitat, setting the stage for future hypothesis-driven research.CONCLUSION By accurately identifying enzymes present in microbial communities, this workflow allows ecological context to inform enzyme characterization, uncovering widespread but previously unappreciated metabolic activities. We are now poised to apply this strategy to examine various patient populations, additional protein superfamilies, and other microbiomes.},

  abstract = {Optical luciferase gene imaging is emerging as a method to monitor gene expression in small animals. However, there is concern over how regional availability of exogenously administered substrate may affect photon emission. We thus synthesized [125I]iodo-D-luciferin, which demonstrated substrate characteristics for firefly luciferase, and investigated its cell uptake kinetics and in vivo biodistribution. Luminescence assays of luc gene transduced cells confirmed a linear decline in emitted light units with decreasing luciferin concentration. Both luc gene transduced and control cells demonstrated a low level of cellular uptake and rapid washout of [125I]iodo-D-luciferin, although early uptake was slightly higher for transduced cells (P $<$ 0.005). Biodistribution in ICR mice demonstrated that early uptakes in liver, lung, myocardium and muscle were lower with intraperitoneal compared to intravenous administration. In view of the poor cell uptake, uptake levels ($<$ 3\%ID/g) suggest that substrate concentration may limit light emission rates in organs such as bone, muscle, myocardium, and particularly the brain. Thus, substrate availability should be considered as a potential limiting factor for photon emission efficiency in certain organs when attempting quantitative interpretation of optical luc gene imaging.},

  doi = {10.1021/bi991181o},
  abstract = {Under physiological conditions firefly luciferase catalyzes the highly efficient emission of yellow-green light from the substrates luciferin, Mg-ATP, and oxygen. In nature, bioluminescence emission by beetle luciferases is observed in colors ranging from green (approximately 530 nm) to red (approximately 635 nm), yet all known luciferases use the same luciferin substrate. In an earlier report [Branchini, B. R., Magyar, R. M., Murtiashaw, M. H., Anderson, S. M., and Zimmer, M. (1998) Biochemistry 37, 15311-15319], we described the effects of mutations at His245 on luciferase activity. In the context of molecular modeling results, we proposed that His245 is located at the luciferase active site. We noted too that the H245 mutants displayed red-shifted bioluminescent emission spectra. We report here the construction and purification of additional His245 mutants, as well as mutants at residues Lys529 and Thr343, all of which are stringently conserved in the beetle luciferase sequences. Analysis of specific activity and steady-state kinetic constants suggested that these residues are involved in luciferase catalysis and the productive binding of substrates. Bioluminescence emission spectroscopy studies indicated that point mutations at His245 and Thr343 produced luciferases that emitted light over the color range from green to red. The results of mutational and biochemical studies with luciferase reported here have enabled us to propose speculative mechanisms for color determination in firefly bioluminescence. An essential role for Thr343, the participation of His245 and Arg218, and the involvement of bound AMP are indicated.},

Given the sequence similarity of PAD2 across mammalian species and the genomic organization of the PAD2 gene, PAD2 is predicted to be the ancestral homologue of the PADs. Although PAD2 has long been known to play a role in myelination, it has only recently been linked to other cellular processes, including gene transcription and macrophage extracellular trap formation. For example, PAD2 deiminates histone H3 at R26, and this PTM leads to the increased transcription of more than 200 genes under the control of the estrogen receptor. Given that our understanding of PAD2 biology remains incomplete, we initiated mechanistic studies on this enzyme to aid the development of PAD2-specific inhibitors.

  abstract = {Protein phosphorylation plays a central role in controlling many diverse signal transduction pathways in all cells. Novel protein kinases are identified at a rapid rate using homology cloning methods and genetic screens or selections; however identification of the direct substrates of kinases has proven elusive to genetic methods because of the tremendous redundancy and overlapping of substrate specificities among protein kinases. We describe the development of a protein engineering-based method to identify the direct substrates of the prototypical protein tyrosine kinase v-Src, which controls fibroblast transformation by the Rous sarcoma virus. To differentiate the substrates of v-Src from all other kinase substrates, we mutated the ATP binding site of v-Src such that the engineered v-Src uniquely accepted an ATP analog. We show that the engineered v-Src kinase displayed catalytic efficiency with the ATP analog, N(6)-(cyclopentyl) ATP, which is similar to the wild-type kinase catalytic efficiency with ATP itself. However, the N(6)-(cyclopentyl) ATP analog was not accepted by the wild-type kinase. Furthermore, the engineered v-Src exhibited the same protein target specificity as wild-type v-Src despite the proximity of the reengineered nucleotide binding site to the phosphoacceptor binding site. The successful engineering of v-Src's active site to accept a unique nucleotide analog provides a unique handle by which the direct substrates of one kinase (v-Src) can be traced in the presence of any number of cellular kinases.},

  abstract = {Light emission from the North American firefly Photinus pyralis, which emits yellow-green (557-nm) light, is widely believed to be the most efficient bioluminescence system known, making this luciferase an excellent tool for monitoring gene expression. We present studies on the production of a set of thermostable red- and green-emitting luciferase mutants with bioluminescent properties suitable for dual-color reporter assays, biosensor measurements with internal controls, and imaging techniques. Starting with the luciferase variant Ser284Thr, we introduced the mutations Thr214Ala, Ala215Leu, Ile232Ala, Phe295Leu, and Glu354Lys to produce a new red-emitting enzyme with a bioluminescence maximum of 610 nm, narrow emission bandwidth, favorable kinetic properties, and excellent thermostability at 37 degrees C. By adding the same five changes to luciferase mutant Val241Ile/Gly246Ala/Phe250Ser, we produced a protein with an emission maximum of 546 nm, providing a set of thermostable enzymes whose bioluminescence maxima were separated by 64 nm. Model studies established that the luciferases could be detected at the attomole level and six orders of magnitude higher. In microplate luminometer format, mixtures containing 1.0 fmol total luciferase were quantified from measurements of simultaneously emitted red and green light. The results presented here provide evidence that it is feasible to monitor two distinct activities at 37 degrees C with these novel thermostable proteins.},

Modification of the carbohydrate was found to be important for stabilizing Nod2 and generating the proper response. The native Nod2 ligands demonstrate a significant increase in the cellular stability of Nod2. Moreover, changing the identity of the natural ligands at the carbohydrate 2-position allows for the Nod2-dependent immune response to be either up-regulated or down-regulated. The ligand structure can be adjusted to tune the Nod2 response, suggesting that other innate immune receptors and their ligands could use a similar strategy.},

  abstract = {Surveillance of the extracellular environment by immune receptors is of central importance to eukaryotic survival. The rice receptor kinase XA21, which confers robust resistance to most strains of the Gram-negative bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae ( Xoo ), is representative of a large class of cell surface immune receptors in plants and animals. We report the identification of a previously undescribed Xoo protein, called RaxX, which is required for activation of XA21-mediated immunity. Xoo strains that lack RaxX, or carry mutations in the single RaxX tyrosine residue (Y41), are able to evade XA21-mediated immunity. Y41 of RaxX is sulfated by the prokaryotic tyrosine sulfotransferase RaxST. Sulfated, but not nonsulfated, RaxX triggers hallmarks of the plant immune response in an XA21-dependent manner. A sulfated, 21\textendash{}amino acid synthetic RaxX peptide (RaxX21-sY) is sufficient for this activity. Xoo field isolates that overcome XA21-mediated immunity encode an alternate raxX allele, suggesting that coevolutionary interactions between host and pathogen contribute to RaxX diversification. RaxX is highly conserved in many plant pathogenic Xanthomonas species. The new insights gained from the discovery and characterization of the sulfated protein, RaxX, can be applied to the development of resistant crop varieties and therapeutic reagents that have the potential to block microbial infection of both plants and animals.},

  doi = {10.1021/sb500282v},
  abstract = {Saturation mutagenesis is employed in protein engineering and genome-editing efforts to generate libraries that span amino acid design space. Traditionally, this is accomplished by using degenerate/compressed codons such as NNK (N = A/C/G/T, K = G/T), which covers all amino acids and one stop codon. These solutions suffer from two types of redundancy: (a) different codons for the same amino acid lead to bias, and (b) wild type amino acid is included within the library. These redundancies increase library size and downstream screening efforts. Here, we present a dynamic approach to compress codons for any desired list of amino acids, taking into account codon usage. This results in a unique codon collection for every amino acid to be mutated, with the desired redundancy level. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach can be used to design precise oligo libraries amendable to recombineering and CRISPR-based genome editing to obtain a diverse population with high efficiency.},

  abstract = {The fate decisions of human pluripotent stem (hPS) cells are governed by soluble and insoluble signals from the microenvironment. Many hPS cell differentiation protocols use Matrigel, a complex and undefined substrate that engages multiple adhesion and signaling receptors. Using defined surfaces programmed to engage specific cell-surface ligands (i.e., glycosaminoglycans and integrins), the contribution of specific matrix signals can be dissected. For ectoderm and motor neuron differentiation, peptide-modified surfaces that can engage both glycosaminoglycans and integrins are effective. In contrast, surfaces that interact selectively with glycosaminoglycans are superior to Matrigel in promoting hPS cell differentiation to definitive endoderm and mesoderm. The modular surfaces were used to elucidate the signaling pathways underlying these differences. Matrigel promotes integrin signaling, which in turn inhibits mesendoderm differentiation. The data indicate that integrin-activating surfaces stimulate Akt signaling via integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which is antagonistic to endoderm differentiation. The ability to attribute cellular responses to specific interactions between the cell and the substrate offers new opportunities for revealing and controlling the pathways governing cell fate.},

We report the development of two dual-color luciferase-producing Lactobacillus (Lb.) plantarum and Lactococcus (Lc.) lactis strains for noninvasive simultaneous tracking in the mouse gastrointestinal tract. We previously described the functional expression of the red luciferase mutant (CBRluc) from Pyrophorus plagiophthalamus in Lb. plantarum NCIMB8826 and Lc. lactis MG1363 (C. Daniel, S. Poiret, V. Dennin, D. Boutillier, and B. Pot, Appl Environ Microbiol 79:1086-1094, 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.03221-12). In this study, we determined that CBRluc is a better-performing luciferase for in vivo localization of both lactic acid bacteria after oral administration than the green click beetle luciferase mutant construct developed in this study. We further established the possibility to simultaneously detect red- and green-emitting lactic acid bacteria by dual-wavelength bioluminescence imaging in combination with spectral unmixing. The difference in spectra of light emission by the red and green click beetle luciferase mutants and dual bioluminescence detection allowed in vitro and in vivo quantification of the red and green emitted signals; thus, it allowed us to monitor the dynamics and fate of the two bacterial populations simultaneously. Persistence and viability of both strains simultaneously administered to mice in different ratios was studied in vivo in anesthetized mice and ex vivo in mouse feces. The application of dual-luciferase-labeled bacteria has considerable potential to simultaneously study the interactions and potential competitions of different targeted bacteria and their hosts.},

  volume = {10},
  doi = {10.1117/1.2032388},
  abstract = {In vivo bioluminescence imaging depends on light emitted by luciferases in the body overcoming the effect of tissue attenuation. Understanding this relationship is essential for detection and quantification of signal. We have studied four codon optimized luciferases with different emission spectra, including enzymes from firefly (FLuc), click beetle (CBGr68, CBRed) and Renilla reniformins (hRLuc). At 25 degrees C, the in vitro lambda(max) of these reporters are 578, 543, 615, and 480 nm, respectively; at body temperature, 37 degrees C, the brightness increases and the firefly enzyme demonstrates a 34-nm spectral red shift. Spectral shifts and attenuation due to tissue effects were evaluated using a series of 20-nm bandpass filters and a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Attenuation increased and the spectra of emitted light was red shifted for signals originating from deeper within the body relative to superficial origins. The tissue attenuation of signals from CBGr68 and hRLuc was greater than from those of Fluc and CBRed. To further probe tissue effects, broad spectral emitters were created through gene fusions between CBGr68 and CBRed. These resulted in enzymes with broader emission spectra, featuring two peaks whose intensities are differentially affected by temperature and tissue depth. These spectral measurement data allow for improved understanding of how these reporters can be used in vivo and what they can reveal about biological processes in living subjects.},

  abstract = {Living organisms produce hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) to kill invading pathogens and for cellular signaling, but aberrant generation of this reactive oxygen species is a hallmark of oxidative stress and inflammation in aging, injury, and disease. The effects of H(2)O(2) on the overall health of living animals remain elusive, in part owing to a dearth of methods for studying this transient small molecule in vivo. Here we report the design, synthesis, and in vivo applications of Peroxy Caged Luciferin-1 (PCL-1), a chemoselective bioluminescent probe for the real-time detection of H(2)O(2) within living animals. PCL-1 is a boronic acid-caged firefly luciferin molecule that selectively reacts with H(2)O(2) to release firefly luciferin, which triggers a bioluminescent response in the presence of firefly luciferase. The high sensitivity and selectivity of PCL-1 for H(2)O(2), combined with the favorable properties of bioluminescence for in vivo imaging, afford a unique technology for real-time detection of basal levels of H(2)O(2) generated in healthy, living mice. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of PCL-1 for monitoring physiological fluctuations in H(2)O(2) levels by directly imaging elevations in H(2)O(2) within testosterone-stimulated tumor xenografts in vivo. The ability to chemoselectively monitor H(2)O(2) fluxes in real time in living animals offers opportunities to dissect H(2)O(2)'s disparate contributions to health, aging, and disease.},

We used fluorogenic molecules to rapidly identify a small ester masking motif that is stable to endogenous esterases, but is efficiently removed by an exogenous esterase. This strategy allows facile targeting of dyes and drugs in complex biological environments to label specific cell types, illuminate gap junction connectivity, and pharmacologically perturb distinct subsets of cells.

We report the identification of novel luciferase mutants which combine improved pH-tolerance and thermostability and that retain the specific activity of the wild-type enzyme. These were identified by the mutagenesis of solvent-exposed non-conserved hydrophobic amino acids to hydrophilic residues in Photinus pyralis firefly luciferase followed by in vivo activity screening. Mutants F14R, L35Q, V182K, I232K and F465R were found to be the preferred substitutions at the respective positions. The effects of these amino acid replacements are additive, since combination of the five substitutions produced an enzyme with greatly improved pH-tolerance and stability up to 45 degrees C. All mutants, including the mutant with all five substitutions, showed neither a decrease in specific activity relative to the recombinant wild-type enzyme, nor any substantial differences in kinetic constants. It is envisaged that the combined mutant will be superior to wild-type luciferase for many in vitro and in vivo applications.},

In addition, Alexa dyes are insensitive to pH in the 4-10 range. We evaluated Alexa dyes compared with conventional dyes in applications using various conjugates, including those of goat anti-mouse IgG (GAM), streptavidin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and concanavalin A (ConA). Conjugates of Alexa 546 are at least twofold more fluorescent than Cy3 conjugates.

While our first demonstration labeled proteins with a coumarin fluorophore, subsequent engineering produced alkyl azide and trans-cyclooctene ligases as well as an interaction-dependent form of the coumarin PRIME method (ID-PRIME). One major limitation of the PRIME methodologies is that LplA mutants have very low activity in the secretory pathway. Here, we extend PRIME labeling to oxidizing compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell surface. We used yeast-display evolution and four rounds of selection to isolate LplA mutants with improved picolyl azide ligation activity.

  abstract = {Protein methyltransferase (PMT)-mediated posttranslational modification of histone and nonhistone substrates modulates stability, localization, and interacting partners of target proteins in diverse cellular contexts. These events play critical roles in normal biological processes and are frequently deregulated in human diseases. In the course of identifying substrates of individual PMTs, bioorthogonal profiling of protein methylation (BPPM) has demonstrated its merits. In this approach, specific PMTs are engineered to process S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) analogs as cofactor surrogates and label their substrates with distinct chemical modifications for target elucidation. Despite the proof-of-concept advancement of BPPM, few efforts have been made to explore its generality. With two cancer-relevant PMTs, EuHMT1 (GLP1/KMT1D) and EuHMT2 (G9a/KMT1C), as models, we defined the key structural features of engineered PMTs and matched SAM analogs that can render the orthogonal enzyme-cofactor pairs for efficient catalysis. Here we have demonstrated that the presence of sulfonium-$\beta$-sp(2) carbon and flexible, medium-sized sulfonium-$\delta$-substituents are crucial for SAM analogs as BPPM reagents. The bulky cofactors can be accommodated by tailoring the conserved Y1211/Y1154 residues and nearby hydrophobic cavities of EuHMT1/2. Profiling proteome-wide substrates with BPPM allowed identification of $>$500 targets of EuHMT1/2 with representative targets validated using native EuHMT1/2 and SAM. This finding indicates that EuHMT1/2 may regulate many cellular events previously unrecognized to be modulated by methylation. The present work, therefore, paves the way to a broader application of the BPPM technology to profile methylomes of diverse PMTs and elucidate their downstream functions.},

Using transgenic mouse models of cancer, we found that expression of Hsp70 in host stromal cells was essential to support tumor growth. Furthermore, genetic ablation or pharmacologic inhibition of Hsp70 suppressed tumor infiltration by macrophages needed to enable tumor growth. Overall, our results illustrate how Hsp70 inhibitors mediate the anticancer effects by targeting both tumor cells and tumor stromal cells, with implications for the broad use of these inhibitors as tools to ablate tumor-associated macrophages that enable malignant progression.

The beetle luciferases are members of a large family of nonbioluminescent proteins that catalyze reactions of ATP with carboxylate substrates to form acyl-adenylates. Formation of the luciferase-luciferyl-AMP complex is a specific example of the chemistry common to this enzyme family. Site-directed mutants at positions Lys529, Thr343, and His245 were studied to determine the effects of the amino acid changes at these positions on the individual luciferase-catalyzed adenylation and oxidation reactions.

At the same time, the network of microtubules in the spindle must be able to apply and sustain large forces to maintain spindle integrity. Here we consider recent efforts to measure forces generated within microtubule networks by ensembles of key proteins. New findings, such as length-dependent force generation, protein clustering by asymmetric friction, and entropic expansion forces will help advance models of force generation needed for spindle function and maintaining integrity.},

  doi = {10.1117/1.3258838},
  abstract = {Spectral unmixing is a useful technique in fluorescence imaging for reducing the effects of native tissue autofluorescence and separating multiple fluorescence probes. While spectral unmixing methods are well established in fluorescence microscopy, they typically rely on precharacterized in-vitro spectra for each fluorophore. However, there are unique challenges for in-vivo applications, since the tissue absorption and scattering can have a significant impact on the measured spectrum of the fluorophore, and therefore make the in-vivo spectra substantially different to that of in vitro. In this work, we introduce a spectral unmixing algorithm tailored for in-vivo optical imaging that does not rely on precharacterized spectral libraries. It is derived from a multivariate curve resolution (MCR) method, which has been widely used in studies of chemometrics and gene expression. Given multispectral images and a few straightforward constraints such as non-negativity, the algorithm automatically finds the signal distribution and the pure spectrum of each component. Signal distribution maps help separate autofluorescence from other probes in the raw images and hence provide better quantification and localization for each probe. The algorithm is demonstrated with an extensive set of in-vivo experiments using near-infrared dyes and quantum dots in both epi-illumination and transillumination geometries.},

To accomplish this goal, we took advantage of the bioorthogonal chemical reporter technique. This strategy uses a two-step labeling procedure in which an unnatural sugar analogue containing a functional handle is (1) incorporated into sugar-bearing proteins via the cell's own biosynthetic machinery and then (2) detected with an exogenously added probe. We designed phosphine-luciferin reagent 1 to activate bioluminescence in response to Staudinger ligation with azide-labeled glycans.

  abstract = {According to the domain alternation mechanism and crystal structure evidence, the acyl-CoA synthetases, one of three subgroups of a superfamily of adenylating enzymes, catalyze adenylate- and thioester-forming half-reactions in two different conformations. The enzymes accomplish this by presenting two active sites through an $\sim$140$^\circ$ rotation of the C-domain. The second half-reaction catalyzed by another subgroup, the beetle luciferases, is a mechanistically dissimilar oxidative process that produces bioluminescence. We have demonstrated that a firefly luciferase variant containing cysteine residues at positions 108 and 447 can be intramolecularly cross-linked by 1,2-bis(maleimido)ethane, trapping the enzyme in a C-domain-rotated conformation previously undocumented in the available luciferase crystal structures. The cross-linked luciferase cannot adenylate luciferin but is nearly fully capable of bioluminescence with synthetic luciferyl adenylate because it retains the ability to carry out the oxidative hal...},

  abstract = {The ability to engineer biological circuits that process and respond to complex cellular signals has the potential to impact many areas of biology and medicine. Transcriptional activator-like effectors (TALEs) have emerged as an attractive component for engineering these circuits, as TALEs can be designed de novo to target a given DNA sequence. Currently, however, the use of TALEs is limited by degeneracy in the site-specific manner by which they recognize DNA. Here, we propose an algorithm to computationally address this problem. We apply our algorithm to design 180 TALEs targeting 20 bp cognate binding sites that are at least 3 nt mismatches away from all 20 bp sequences in putative 2 kb human promoter regions. We generated eight of these synthetic TALE activators and showed that each is able to activate transcription from a targeted reporter. Importantly, we show that these proteins do not activate synthetic reporters containing mismatches similar to those present in the genome nor a set of endogenous genes predicted to be the most likely targets in vivo. Finally, we generated and characterized TALE repressors comprised of our orthogonal DNA binding domains and further combined them with shRNAs to accomplish near complete repression of target gene expression.},

  abstract = {Bioluminescence imaging became a widely used technique for noninvasive study of biological processes in small animals. Bioluminescent probes with emission in near-infrared (NIR) spectral region confer the advantage of having deep tissue penetration capacity. However, there are a very limited number of currently available luciferases that exhibit NIR bioluminescence. Here, we engineered two novel chimeric probes based on RLuc8 luciferase fused with iRFP670 and iRFP720 NIR fluorescent proteins. Due to an intramolecular bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) between RLuc8 and iRFPs, the chimeric luciferases exhibit NIR bioluminescence with maxima at 670\,nm and 720\,nm, respectively. The 50\,nm spectral shift between emissions of the two iRFP chimeras enables combined multicolor bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and the respective multicolor fluorescence imaging (FLI) of the iRFPs. We show that for subcutaneously implanted cells, NIR bioluminescence provided a 10-fold increase in sensitivity compared to NIR FLI. In deep tissues, NIR BLI enabled detection of as low as 104 cells. Both BLI and FLI allowed monitoring of tumor growth and metastasis from early to late stages. Multimodal imaging, which combines concurrent BLI and FLI, provides continuous spatiotemporal analysis of metastatic cells in animals, including their localization and quantification.},

  abstract = {The suborder Corynebacterineae encompasses species like Corynebacterium glutamicum, which has been harnessed for industrial production of amino acids, as well as Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which cause devastating human diseases. A distinctive component of the Corynebacterineae cell envelope is the mycolyl-arabinogalactan (mAG) complex. The mAG is composed of lipid mycolic acids, and arabinofuranose (Araf) and galactofuranose (Galf) carbohydrate residues. Elucidating microbe-specific differences in mAG composition could advance biotechnological applications and lead to new antimicrobial targets. To this end, we compare and contrast galactan biosynthesis in C. diphtheriae and M. tuberculosis In each species, the galactan is constructed from uridine 5'-diphosphate-$\alpha$-d-galactofuranose (UDP-Galf), which is generated by the enzyme UDP-galactopyranose mutase (UGM or Glf). UGM and the galactan are essential in M. tuberculosis, but their importance in Corynebacterium species was not known. We show that small molecule inhibitors of UGM impede C. glutamicum growth, suggesting that the galactan is critical in corynebacteria. Previous cell wall analysis data suggest the galactan polymer is longer in mycobacterial species than corynebacterial species. To explore the source of galactan length variation, a C. diphtheriae ortholog of the M. tuberculosis carbohydrate polymerase responsible for the bulk of galactan polymerization, GlfT2, was produced, and its catalytic activity was evaluated. The C. diphtheriae GlfT2 gave rise to shorter polysaccharides than those obtained with the M. tuberculosis GlfT2. These data suggest that GlfT2 alone can influence galactan length. Our results provide tools, both small molecule and genetic, for probing and perturbing the assembly of the Corynebacterineae cell envelope.},

  abstract = {Bioluminescence imaging has evolved as a powerful tool for monitoring biological processesin vivo. As transmission efficiency of light through tissue increases greatly for wavelengths above 600 nm we examined whether a redshifted codon-optimized firefly luciferase ($\lambda$max = 615 nm) could be successfully employed as a sensitive reporter in mammalian cells. To this end, unmodified codon-optimized luciferase ($\lambda$max = 557 nm) as well as the red-emitting S284T mutant luciferase were expressed simultaneously in human glioma cellsin vitro as well as in quadriceps muscles of mice in vivo. We show here that activity of the redshifted enzyme in human glioma cell culture approached approximately one-fourth of that seen with the unmodified enzyme. In contrast, light emission by the red-emitting luciferase in vivo was generally more efficient than that produced by its unmodified counterpart, most likely due to reduced absorption of red light by tissue. The mean ratio of light emission produced by the redshifted luciferase to that of the unmodified enzymein vivo was 3. Application of this new redshifted luciferase together with other optical reporters may be of considerable importance to biological research as it allows for imaging of deeper tissues as well as simultaneous monitoring of two molecular events in vitro and in vivo if appropriate filter sets are employed.},

  abstract = {Many human proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions, and disorder in these proteins can be fundamental to their function-for example, facilitating transient but specific binding, promoting allostery, or allowing efficient posttranslational modification. SasG, a multidomain protein implicated in host colonization and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus, provides another example of how disorder can play an important role. Approximately one-half of the domains in the extracellular repetitive region of SasG are intrinsically unfolded in isolation, but these E domains fold in the context of their neighboring folded G5 domains. We have previously shown that the intrinsic disorder of the E domains mediates long-range cooperativity between nonneighboring G5 domains, allowing SasG to form a long, rod-like, mechanically strong structure. Here, we show that the disorder of the E domains coupled with the remarkable stability of the interdomain interface result in cooperative folding kinetics across long distances. Formation of a small structural nucleus at one end of the molecule results in rapid structure formation over a distance of 10 nm, which is likely to be important for the maintenance of the structural integrity of SasG. Moreover, if this normal folding nucleus is disrupted by mutation, the interdomain interface is sufficiently stable to drive the folding of adjacent E and G5 domains along a parallel folding pathway, thus maintaining cooperative folding.},

To increase detection sensitivity and response dynamics, we genetically engineered firefly luciferase to detect specific intermolecular interactions through modulation of its luminescence activity. This concept has been applied in covalent, noncovalent, and allosteric design configurations. The covalent design gives sensitive detection of protease activity through a cleavage-dependent increase in luminescence. The noncovalent and allosteric designs allow reversible detection of the small molecules rapamycin and cAMP, respectively. These sensors allow detection of molecular processes within living cells following addition of the luciferin substrate to the growth medium. For example, the cAMP sensor allows monitoring of intracellular signal transduction associated with G-protein coupled receptor function. These and other...},

Citrullinated synovial proteins, which are generated via the actions of the protein arginine deiminases (PADs), are known to develop in the murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model of inflammatory arthritis. Given these findings, we evaluated whether N-$\alpha$-benzoyl-N5-(2-chloro-1-iminoethyl)-l-ornithine amide (Cl-amidine), a recently described pan-PAD inhibitor, could affect the development of arthritis and autoimmunity by treating mice in the CIA model with Cl-amidine on days 0\textendash{}35. Cl-amidine treatment reduced total synovial and serum citrullination, decreased clinical disease activity by $\sim$50\%, and significantly decreased IgG2a anti-mouse type II collagen Abs. Additionally, histopathology scores and total complement C3 deposition were significantly lower in Cl-amidine\textendash{}treated mice compared with vehicle controls. Synovial microarray analyses demonstrated decreased IgG reactivity to several native and citrullinated epitopes compared with vehicle controls. Cl-amidine treatment had no ameliorative effect on collagen Ab-induced arthritis, suggesting its primary protective mechanism was not mediated through effector pathways. Reduced levels of citrullinated synovial proteins observed in mice treated with Cl-amidine are consistent with the notion that Cl-amidine derives its efficacy from its ability to inhibit the deiminating activity of PADs. In total, these results suggested that PADs are necessary participants in the autoimmune and subsequent inflammatory processes in CIA. Cl-amidine may represent a novel class of disease-modifying agents that modulate aberrant citrullination, and perhaps other immune processes, necessary for the development of inflammatory arthritis.},

  abstract = {Bioluminescent and fluorescent reporters are finding increased use in optical molecular imaging in small animals. In the work presented here, issues related to the sensitivity of in vivo detection are examined for standard reporters. A high-sensitivity imaging system that can detect steady-state emission from both bioluminescent and fluorescent reporters is described. The instrument is absolutely calibrated so that animal images can be analyzed in physical units of radiance allowing more quantitative comparisons to be performed. Background emission from mouse tissue, called autoluminescence and autofluorescence, is measured and found to be an important limitation to detection sensitivity of reporters. Measurements of dual-labeled (bioluminescent/fluorescent) reporter systems, including PC-3M-luc/DsRed2-1 and HeLa-luc/PKH26, are shown. The results indicate that although fluorescent signals are generally brighter than bioluminescent signals, the very low autoluminescent levels usually results in superior signal to background ratios for bioluminescent imaging, particularly compared with fluorescent imaging in the green to red part of the spectrum. Fluorescence detection sensitivity improves in the far-red to near-infrared, provided the animals are fed a low-chlorophyll diet to reduce autofluorescence in the intestinal region. The use of blue-shifted excitation filters is explored as a method to subtract out tissue autofluorescence and improve the sensitivity of fluorescent imaging.},

Two designed analogues of the RNase A protein molecule that contained an adenine moiety covalently bound to distinct amino acid side chains adjacent to the adenine binding pocket were prepared. A crystal structure of one analogue was determined at 2.3 \AA{} resolution. Kinetic data for RNA transphosporylation and 2${'}$,3${'}$ cyclic mononucleotide hydrolysis were acquired for the adenine-containing RNase A analogue proteins. As anticipated, the presence of a covalently attached adenine on the enzyme molecule decreased the rate of transphosphorylation and increased the rate of hydrolysis, although the magnitude of the effects was small. This work illustrates the use of total protein synthesis to investigate the chemistry of enzyme catalysis in ways not possible through traditional biochemistry or molecular biology.},

Unexpectedly, ablation of Lgr5+ cells only leads to temporary tumour regression and tumour growth resumes driven by KRT20+ cells that exhibit compensatory proliferation and conversion to Lgr5+ cells. They also find that targeting tumours with an anti-EGFR antibody that upregulates Lgr5 acts in synergy with Lgr5+ cell ablation to block tumour growth.

  abstract = {Firefly luciferase is one of the few soluble proteins that is acted upon by a wide variety of general anesthetics and alcohols; they inhibit the ATP-driven production of light. We have used time-resolved photolabeling to locate the binding sites of alcohols during the initial light output, some 200 ms after adding ATP. The photolabel 3-azioctanol inhibited the initial light output with an IC50 of 200 $\mathrm{\mu}$M, close to its general anesthetic potency. Photoincorporation of [(3)H]3-azioctanol into luciferase was saturable but weak. It was enhanced 200 ms after adding ATP but was negligible minutes later. Sequencing of tryptic digests by HPLC-MSMS revealed a similar conformation-dependence for photoincorporation of 3-azioctanol into Glu-313, a residue that lines the bottom of a deep cleft (vestibule) whose outer end binds luciferin. An aromatic diazirine analog of benzyl alcohol with broader side chain reactivity reported two sites. First, it photolabeled two residues in the vestibule, Ser-286 and Ile-288, both of which are implicated with Glu-313 in the conformation change accompanying activation. Second, it photolabeled two residues that contact luciferin, Ser-316 and Ser-349. Thus, time resolved photolabeling supports two mechanisms of action. First, an allosteric one, in which anesthetics bind in the vestibule displacing water molecules that are thought to be involved in light output. Second, a competitive one, in which anesthetics bind isosterically with luciferin. This work provides structural evidence that supports the competitive and allosteric actions previously characterized by kinetic studies.},

  abstract = {The continual public health threat posed by the emergence of novel influenza viruses necessitates the ability to rapidly monitor infection and spread in experimental systems. To analyze real-time infection dynamics, we have created a replication-competent influenza reporter virus suitable for in vivo imaging. The reporter virus encodes the small and bright NanoLuc luciferase whose activity serves as an extremely sensitive readout of viral infection. This virus stably maintains the reporter construct and replicates in culture and in mice with near-native properties. Bioluminescent imaging of the reporter virus permits serial observations of viral load and dissemination in infected animals, even following clearance of a sublethal challenge. We further show that the reporter virus recapitulates known restrictions due to host range and antiviral treatment, suggesting that this technology can be applied to studying emerging influenza viruses and the impact of antiviral interventions on infections in vivo. These results describe a generalizable method to quickly determine the replication and pathogenicity potential of diverse influenza strains in animals.},

This is a potent inhibitor of HPA (Ki~= 7~nM) yet exhibits selectivity for the target over other glycosidases tested. Structural studies show that this nonapeptide forms a compact tertiary structure, and illustrate that a general inhibitory motif involving two phenolic groups is often accessed for tight binding of inhibitors to HPA. Furthermore, the work reported here demonstrates the potential of this methodology for the discovery of de novo peptide inhibitors against other glycosidases.},

  abstract = {PAR-2 belongs to a family of G-protein coupled Protease-Activated Receptors (PAR) which are activated by specific proteolytic cleavage in the extracellular N-terminal region. PAR-2 is activated by proteases such as trypsin, tryptase, proteinase 3, factor VIIa, factor Xa and is thought to be a mediator of inflammation and tissue injury, where elevated levels of proteases are found. Utilizing the HuCAL GOLD\textregistered{} phage display library we generated fully human antibodies specifically blocking the protease cleavage site in the N-terminal domain. In vitro affinity optimization resulted in antibodies with up to 1000-fold improved affinities relative to the original parental antibodies with dissociation constants as low as 100 pM. Corresponding increases in potency were observed in a mechanistic protease cleavage assay. The antibodies effectively inhibited PAR-2 mediated intracellular calcium release and cytokine secretion in various cell types stimulated with trypsin. In addition, the antibodies demonstrated potent inhibition of trypsin induced relaxation of isolated rat aortic rings ex vivo. In a short term mouse model of inflammation, the trans vivo DTH model, anti-PAR-2 antibodies showed inhibition of the inflammatory swelling response. In summary, potent inhibitors of PAR-2 were generated which allow further assessment of the role of this receptor in inflammation and evaluation of their potential as therapeutic agents.},

Our data demonstrate that reduction of the triplet state and photoinduced oxidation of reactive intermediates by oxygen represents a general mechanism for reversible photoswitching of dyes in aqueous thiol-containing solutions highlighting the key role of molecular oxygen for super-resolution fluorescence imaging.

  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1509428113},
  abstract = {Light-oxygen-voltage sensitive (LOV) flavoproteins are ubiquitous photoreceptors that mediate responses to environmental cues. Photosensory inputs are transduced into signaling outputs via structural rearrangements in sensor domains that consequently modulate the activity of an effector domain or multidomain clusters. Establishing the diversity in effector function and sensor-effector topology will inform what signaling mechanisms govern light-responsive behaviors across multiple kingdoms of life and how these signals are transduced. Here, we report the bioinformatics identification of over 6,700 candidate LOV domains (including over 4,000 previously unidentified sequences from plants and protists), and insights from their annotations for ontological function and structural arrangements. Motif analysis identified the sensors from $\sim$42 million ORFs, with strong statistical separation from other flavoproteins and non-LOV members of the structurally related Per-aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)-Sim family. Conserved-domain analysis determined putative light-regulated function and multidomain topologies. We found that for certain effectors, sensor-effector linker length is discretized based on both phylogeny and the preservation of $\alpha$-helical heptad repeats within an extended coiled-coil linker structure. This finding suggests that preserving sensor-effector orientation is a key determinant of linker length, in addition to ancestry, in LOV signaling structure-function. We found a surprisingly high prevalence of effectors with functions previously thought to be rare among LOV proteins, such as regulators of G protein signaling, and discovered several previously unidentified effectors, such as lipases. This work highlights the value of applying genomic and transcriptomic technologies to diverse organisms to capture the structural and functional variation in photosensory proteins that are vastly important in adaptation, photobiology, and optogenetics.},

In the presence of a non-toxic FDA-approved drug, the nanorings were quickly disassembled and the cell-cell interactions reversed. Similar to T-cells genetically engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARS), when activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were functionalized with the anti-EpCAM-lipid-CSANs, they were shown to selectively kill antigen-positive cancer cells.

The calculated barrier heights for the firefly dioxetanone and its analogs surrounded by the firefly Photinus pyralis luciferase show that the energy barrier of the firefly dioxetanone is lowered by the luciferase, but is raised for the other analog. Thus the thermolysis rate is enhanced for the natural D-luciferin and reduced for the other by the firefly luciferase, which elucidates why the luciferase acts as a catalyst for the natural D-luciferin but makes some luciferins emit weaker light signals.},

  abstract = {Reporter mice that enable the activity of the endogenous p21 promoter to be dynamically monitored in real time in vivo and under a variety of experimental conditions revealed ubiquitous p21 expression in mouse organs including the brain. Low light bioluminescence microscopy was employed to localize p21 expression to specific regions of the brain. Interestingly, p21 expression was observed in the paraventricular, arcuate, and dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus, regions that detect nutrient levels in the blood stream and signal metabolic actions throughout the body. These results suggested a link between p21 expression and metabolic regulation. We found that short-term food deprivation (fasting) potently induced p21 expression in tissues involved in metabolic regulation including liver, pancreas and hypothalamic nuclei. Conditional reporter mice were generated that enabled hepatocyte-specific expression of p21 to be monitored in vivo. Bioluminescence imaging demonstrated that fasting induced a 7-fold increase in p21 expression in livers of reporter mice and Western blotting demonstrated an increase in protein levels as well. The ability of fasting to induce p21 expression was found to be independent of p53 but dependent on FOXO1. Finally, occupancy of the endogenous p21 promoter by FOXO1 was observed in the livers of fasted but not fed mice. Thus, fasting promotes loading of FOXO1 onto the p21 promoter to induce p21 expression in hepatocytes.},

  abstract = {Information transmission in biological signaling networks is commonly considered to be a unidirectional flow of information between protein partners. According to this view, many bacterial response regulator proteins utilize input receiver (REC) domains to "switch" functional outputs, using REC phosphorylation to shift pre-existing equilibria between inactive and active conformations. However, recent data indicate that output domains themselves also shift such equilibria, implying a "mutual inhibition" model. Here we use solution nuclear magnetic resonance to provide a mechanistic basis for such control in a PhyR-type response regulator. Our structure of~the isolated, non-phosphorylated REC domain surprisingly reveals a fully active conformation, letting us identify structural and dynamic changes imparted by the output domain to inactivate the full-length protein. Additional data reveal transient structural changes within the full-length protein, facilitating activation. Our data provide a basis for understanding the changes that REC and output domains undergo to set a default "inactive" state.},

  abstract = {Interactions among neighboring cells underpin many physiological processes ranging from early development to immune responses. When these interactions do not function properly, numerous pathologies, including infection and cancer, can result. Molecular imaging technologies, especially optical imaging, are uniquely suited to illuminate complex cellular interactions within the context of living tissues in the body. However, no tools yet exist that allow the detection of microscopic events, such as two cells coming into close proximity, on a global, whole-animal scale. We report here a broadly applicable, longitudinal strategy for probing interactions among cells in living subjects. This approach relies on the generation of bioluminescent light when two distinct cell populations come into close proximity, with the intensity of the optical signal correlating with relative cellular location. We demonstrate the ability of this reporter strategy to gauge cell-cell proximity in culture models in vitro and then evaluate this approach for imaging tumor-immune cell interactions using a murine breast cancer model. In these studies, our imaging strategy enabled the facile visualization of features that are otherwise difficult to observe with conventional imaging techniques, including detection of micrometastatic lesions and potential sites of tumor immunosurveillance. This proximity reporter will facilitate probing of numerous types of cell-cell interactions and will stimulate the development of similar techniques to detect rare events and pathological processes in live animals.},

Intramolecular interactions are by far the most common manifestation of this effect, which offers a means of modulating the conformational preferences of a molecule. Although a well-documented phenomenon, a priori applications in drug design are relatively sparse and this interaction, which is often isosteric with an intramolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction, appears to be underappreciated by the medicinal chemistry community. In this Perspective, we discuss the theoretical basis for sulfur $\sigma$* orbital interactions and illustrate their importance in the context of drug design and organic synthesis. The role of sulfur interactions in protein structure and function is discussed and although relatively rare, intermolecular interactions between ligand C-S $\sigma$* orbitals and proteins are illustrated.},

  volume = {95},
  abstract = {The present paper describes the total chemical synthesis of the precursor molecule of the Aequorea green fluorescent protein (GFP). The molecule is made up of 238 amino acid residues in a single polypeptide chain and is nonfluorescent. To carry out the synthesis, a procedure, first described in 1981 for the synthesis of complex peptides, was used. The procedure is based on performing segment condensation reactions in solution while providing maximum protection to the segment. The effectiveness of the procedure has been demonstrated by the synthesis of various biologically active peptides and small proteins, such as human angiogenin, a 123-residue protein analogue of ribonuclease A, human midkine, a 121-residue protein, and pleiotrophin, a 136-residue protein analogue of midkine. The GFP precursor molecule was synthesized from 26 fully protected segments in solution, and the final 238-residue peptide was treated with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride to obtain the precursor molecule of GFP containing two Cys(acetamidomethyl) residues. After removal of the acetamidomethyl groups, the product was dissolved in 0.1 M Tris. HCl buffer (pH 8.0) in the presence of DTT. After several hours at room temperature, the solution began to emit a green fluorescence (lambdamax = 509 nm) under near-UV light. Both fluorescence excitation and fluorescence emission spectra were measured and were found to have the same shape and maxima as those reported for native GFP. The present results demonstrate the utility of the segment condensation procedure in synthesizing large protein molecules such as GFP. The result also provides evidence that the formation of the chromophore in GFP is not dependent on any external cofactor.},

Skin, in particular, has a strong autofluorescence signal, particularly when excited in the blue or green wavelengths. Fluorescence labels with emission wavelengths in the near-infrared are more amenable to deep-tissue imaging, because both scattering and autofluorescence are reduced as wavelengths are increased, but even in these spectral regions, autofluorescence can still limit sensitivity. Multispectral imaging (MSI), however, can remove the signal degradation caused by autofluorescence while adding enhanced multiplexing capabilities. While the availability of spectral "libraries" makes multispectral analysis routine for well-characterized samples, new software tools have been developed that greatly simplify the application of MSI to novel specimens.},

  abstract = {Despite their versatility and power in controlling gene regulation in nature, nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) have largely eluded utility in heterologous gene regulation applications such as gene therapy and metabolic engineering. The main reason for this void is the pleiotropic interference of the receptor-ligand combination with regulatory networks in the host organism. In recent years, numerous strategies have been developed to engineer ligand-receptor pairs that do not cross-interact with host regulatory pathways. However, these strategies have either met with limited success or cannot be readily extended to other ligand-receptor pairs. Here, we present a simple, effective, and readily generalizable strategy for reengineering NHRs to respond specifically to a selected synthetic ligand. The method involves generation of genetic diversity by stepwise individual site saturation mutagenesis of a fixed set of ligand-contacting residues and random point mutagenesis, followed by phenotypic screening based on a yeast two-hybrid system. As a test case, this method was used to alter the specificity of the NHR human estrogen receptor alpha in favor of the synthetic ligand 4,4'-dihydroxybenzil, relative to the natural ligand 17beta-estradiol, by $>$10(7)-fold. The resulting ligand-receptor pair is highly sensitive to the synthetic ligand in human endometrial cancer cells and is essentially fully orthogonal to the wild-type receptor-natural ligand pair. This method should provide a powerful, broadly applicable tool for engineering receptors/enzymes with improved or novel ligand/substrate specificity.},

  abstract = {Chemically self-assembled nanorings (CSANs) are made of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) fusion proteins and have been successfully used in vitro for cellular cargo delivery and cell surface engineering applications. However, CSANs have yet to be evaluated for their in vivo stability, circulation, and tissue distribution. In an effort to evaluate CSANs in vivo, we engineered a site-specifically PEGylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting DHFR molecules, characterized their self-assembly into CSANs with bivalent methotrexates (bis-MTX), visualized their in vivo tissue localization by microPET/CT imaging, and determined their ex vivo organ biodistribution by tissue-based gamma counting. A dimeric DHFR (DHFR(2)) molecule fused with a C-terminal EGFR targeting peptide (LARLLT) was engineered to incorporate a site-specific ketone functionality using unnatural amino acid mutagenesis. Aminooxy-PEG, of differing chain lengths, was successfully conjugated to the protein using oxime chemistry. These proteins were self-assembled into CSANs with bis-MTX DHFR dimerizers and characterized by size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering. In vitro binding studies were performed with fluorescent CSANs assembled using bis-MTX-FITC, while in vivo microPET/CT imaging was performed with radiolabeled CSANs assembled using bis-MTX-DOTA[(64)Cu]. PEGylation reduced the uptake of anti-EGFR CSANs by mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7) up to 40\% without altering the CSAN's binding affinity toward U-87 MG glioblastoma cells in vitro. A significant time dependent tumor accumulation of (64)Cu labeled anti-EGFR-CSANs was observed by microPET/CT imaging and biodistribution studies in mice bearing U-87 MG xenografts. PEGylated CSANs demonstrated a reduced uptake by the liver, kidneys, and spleen resulting in high contrast tumor imaging within an hour of intravenous injection (9.6\% ID/g), and continued to increase up to 24 h (11.7\% ID/g) while the background signal diminished. CSANs displayed an in vivo profile between those of rapidly clearing small molecules and slow clearing antibodies. Thus, CSANs offer a modular, programmable, and stable protein based platform that can be used for in vivo drug delivery and imaging applications.},

Although effective in many cases, the expense and unfavorable biochemical attributes of the substrate (phenylcoelenterazine) limit utility of Rluc-based BRET systems. Herein we report a series of novel BRET pairs based on luciferases that utilize D-luciferin, resulting in red-shifted photonic outputs, favorable biochemical attributes, and increased efficacy. We developed a modified F{\"o}rster equation to predict optimal BRET luciferase donor-fluorophore pairs and identified tdTomato as the optimal red fluorophore acceptor for click beetle green luciferase (CBG). A prototypical single-chain protease biosensor, capable of reporting on executioner caspase activity in live cells and in real-time, was generated by inserting a DEVD linker between CBG and tdTomato and validated in vitro with recombinant caspases and in cellulo with apoptosis-sensitive and -resistant cell lines. High signal-to-noise ratios ( approximately 33) and Z' factors (0.85) were observed in live cell longitudinal studies, sufficient for high-throughput screening. Thus, we illustrate a general methodology for the rational design of new BRET systems and provide a novel single-chain BRET protease biosensor that is long lived, red-shifted, and utilizes D-luciferin.},

Some of these MBP-BLA switches were effectively "on-off" in nature, with maltose altering catalytic activity by as much as 600-fold. The ability of these switches to confer an effector-dependent growth/no growth phenotype to E. coli cells was exploited to rapidly identify, from a library of 4 x 10(6) variants, MBP-BLA switch variants that respond to sucrose as the effector. The transplantation of these mutations into wild-type MBP converted MBP into a "sucrose-binding protein," illustrating the switches potential as a tool to rapidly identify ligand-binding proteins.},

Using the prototypical dye tetramethylsulforhodamine, TMSR, as a benchmark, we show this new dye has higher fluorescent quantum yields, $\Phi$, ($\Phi$ = 0.95 vs $\Phi$ = 0.65 at 20 $^\circ$C), emission efficiencies that are invariant in the 20$\rightarrow$ 60 $^\circ$C temperature range ($\Phi$ = 0.95 vs $\Phi$ = 0.38 at 60 $^\circ$C), and fluorescence lifetimes that increase with a rise in temperature (20 $\rightarrow$ 60 $^\circ$C) as compared to a decrease for the benchmark dye (3.8 $\rightarrow$ 3.9 vs 2.8 $\rightarrow$ 1.7 ns). Importantly, photostability studies found the azabicyclic rhodamine to be many times more stable than its tetramethyl analogue. To the best our knowledge this is the first report of the use of an apex-N-substituted azabicycloalkane as an electron donor group in any class of donor-acceptor dye. Thus, the concept of using an apex-substitutes bicyclic amine as a donor moiety constitutes a new paradigm for...},

The activation domains, for example, of transcriptional activators were labeled as negative noodles, with little structure or specificity. However, emerging data illustrates that the opposite is true: conformational heterogeneity enables context-specific function to emerge in response to changing cellular conditions and, furthermore, allows a single structural motif to be used in multiple settings. A further benefit is that conformational heterogeneity can be harnessed for the discovery of allosteric drug-like modulators, targeting critical pathways in protein homeostasis and transcription.},

Contrary to this view, molten globule proteins can adopt native topology and bind targets tightly and specifically in the absence of side chain close-packing. The molten globule is a highly dynamic form with native-like secondary structure and a loose protein core that admits solvent. The related (but still controversial) dry molten globule is an expanded form of the native protein with largely intact topology but a tighter protein core that excludes solvent. Neither form retains side chain close-packing, and therefore both structure and function must result from other factors, assuming that the reality of the dry molten globule is accepted. This simplifying realization calls for a re-evaluation of established models.},

A series of rationally modified fluorogen analogues have been made to probe the interacting groups of fluorogen with the aptamer.

  abstract = {The molecular structure of the pepstatin-insensitive carboxyl peptidase from Scytalidium lignicolum, formerly known as scytalidopepsin B, was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement phasing methods and refined to an R factor of 0.230 (R(free) = 0.246) at 2.1-A resolution. In addition to the structure of the unbound peptidase, the structure of a product complex of cleaved angiotensin II bound in the active site of the enzyme was also determined. We propose the name scytalidocarboxyl peptidase B (SCP-B) for this enzyme. On the basis of conserved, catalytic residues identified at the active site, we suggest the name Eqolisin for the enzyme family. The previously uninvestigated SCP-B fold is that of a beta-sandwich; each sheet has seven antiparallel strands. A tripeptide product, Ala-Ile-His, bound in the active site of SCP-B has allowed for identification of the catalytic residues and the residues in subsites S1, S2, and S3, which are important for substrate binding. The most likely hydrolytic mechanism involves nucleophilic attack of a general base (Glu-136)-activated water (OH(-)) on the si-face of the scissile peptide carbonylcarbon atom to form a tetrahedral intermediate. Electrophilic assistance and oxyanion stabilization is provided by the side-chain amide of Gln-53. Protonation of the leaving-group nitrogen is accomplished by the general acid function of the protonated carboxyl group of Glu-136.},

By combining a method to biosynthesize phosphothreonine in cells with this selection approach, we discover a phosphothreonyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNACUA pair and create an entirely biosynthetic route to incorporating phosphothreonine in proteins. We biosynthesize several phosphoproteins and demonstrate phosphoprotein structure determination and synthetic protein kinase activation.},

  abstract = {Computer simulations of the evolution of linear sequences have demonstrated the importance of recombination of blocks of sequence rather than point mutagenesis alone. Repeated cycles of point mutagenesis, recombination, and selection should allow in vitro molecular evolution of complex sequences, such as proteins. A method for the reassembly of genes from their random DNA fragments, resulting in in vitro recombination is reported. A 1-kb gene, after DNase I digestion and purification of 10- to 50-bp random fragments, was reassembled to its original size and function. Similarly, a 2.7-kb plasmid could be efficiently reassembled. Complete recombination was obtained between two markers separated by 75 bp; each marker was located on a separate gene. Oligonucleotides with 3' and 5' ends that are homologous to the gene can be added to the fragment mixture and incorporated into the reassembled gene. Thus, mixtures of synthetic oligonucleotides and PCR fragments can be mixed into a gene at defined positions based on homology. As an example, a library of chimeras of the human and murine genes for interleukin 1 beta has been prepared. Shuffling can also be used for the in vitro equivalent of some standard genetic manipulations, such as a backcross with parental DNA. The advantages of recombination over existing mutagenesis methods are likely to increase with the numbers of cycles of molecular evolution.},

  abstract = {The accumulation of unfolded proteins under endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leads to the activation of the multidomain protein sensor IRE1$\alpha$ as part of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Clustering of IRE1$\alpha$ lumenal domains in the presence of unfolded proteins promotes kinase trans-autophosphorylation in the cytosol and subsequent RNase domain activation. Interestingly, there is an allosteric relationship between the kinase and RNase domains of IRE1$\alpha$, which allows ATP-competitive inhibitors to modulate the activity of the RNase domain. Here, we use kinase inhibitors to study how ATP-binding site conformation affects the activity of the RNase domain of IRE1$\alpha$. We find that diverse ATP-competitive inhibitors of IRE1$\alpha$ promote dimerization and activation of RNase activity despite blocking kinase autophosphorylation. In contrast, a subset of ATP-competitive ligands, which we call KIRAs, allosterically inactivate the RNase domain through the kinase domain by stabilizing monomeric IRE1$\alpha$. Further insight into how ATP-competitive inhibitors are able to divergently modulate the RNase domain through the kinase domain was gained by obtaining the first structure of apo human IRE1$\alpha$ in the RNase active back-to-back dimer conformation. Comparison of this structure with other existing structures of IRE1$\alpha$ and integration of our extensive structure activity relationship (SAR) data has led us to formulate a model to rationalize how ATP-binding site ligands are able to control the IRE1$\alpha$ oligomeric state and subsequent RNase domain activity.},

  abstract = {Five esters of luciferin were synthesized and compared with native luciferin as substrates for firefly luciferase expressed in live intact mammalian cells. The esters themselves were not substrates for purified luciferase, but four were substrates for a purified esterase and all appeared to be hydrolysed to luciferin within mammalian cells. At a substrate concentration of 0.01 mM, the peak luminescence from the cos cells expressing luciferase was up to 6-fold greater with the esters than with unmodified luciferin. At 0.1 mM, the difference between luciferin and the esters was decreased. The kinetics of the luminescent signal with the different luciferin esters varied significantly, indicating possible differences in the rates of uptake, breakdown and enzyme inhibition. The esters did not support luminescence from Escherichia coli cells expressing firefly luciferase, suggesting a lack of appropriate esterase activity in this particular strain. The esters could be useful for the assay of luciferase expression in intact mammalian cells when luciferin levels are limiting, for example in tissues, and in plants. Alternative luciferin derivatives may allow further improvements in sensitivity.},

In this study, we report the expansion of this strategy into non-Cys ligation sites, utilizing radical initiated desulfurization to ``erase'' the side chain thiol after ligation. The reaction exhibited high chemoselectivity against thioamides, which can be further enhanced with thioacetamide as a sacrificial scavenger. As a proof-of-concept example, we demonstrated the incorporation of a thioamide probe into a 56 amino acid protein, the B1 domain of Protein G (GB1). Finally, we showed that the method can be extended to $\beta$-thiol amino acid analogs and selenocysteine.},

Three general methods are currently available for imaging protein-protein interactions in living subjects using reporter genes: a modified mammalian two-hybrid system, a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) system, and split reporter protein complementation and reconstitution strategies.

With noninvasive imaging approaches, as few as 10 cells of stably labeled BCSCs could be tracked in vivo, enabling studies of early tumor growth and spontaneous metastasis. These advances in BCSC imaging revealed that CD44(+) cells from both primary tumors and lung metastases are highly enriched for tumor-initiating cells. Our metastatic cancer models, combined with noninvasive imaging techniques, constitute an integrated approach that could be applied to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the dissemination of metastatic CSCs (MCSCs) and to explore therapeutic strategies targeting MCSCs in general or to evaluate individual patient tumor cells and predict response to therapy.},

  abstract = {The biosynthesis of the luciferin coelenterazine has remained a mystery for decades. While not all organisms that use coelenterazine appear to make it themselves, it is thought that ctenophores are a likely producer. Here we analyze the transcriptome data of 24 species of ctenophores, two of which have published genomes. The natural precursors of coelenterazine have been shown to be the amino acids L-tyrosine and L-phenylalanine, with the most likely biosynthetic pathway involving cyclization and further modification of the tripeptide Phe-Tyr-Tyr (``FYY''). Therefore, we searched the ctenophore transcriptome data for genes with the short peptide ``FYY'' as part of their coding sequence. We recovered a group of candidate genes for coelenterazine biosynthesis in the luminous species which encode a set of highly conserved non-heme iron oxidases similar to isopenicillin-N-synthase. These genes were absent in the transcriptomes and genome of the two non-luminous species. Pairwise identities and substitution rates reveal an unusually high degree of identity even between the most unrelated species. Additionally, two related groups of non-heme iron oxidases were found across all ctenophores, including those which are non-luminous, arguing against the involvement of these two gene groups in luminescence. Important residues for iron-binding are conserved across all proteins in the three groups, suggesting this function is still present. Given the known functions of other members of this protein superfamily are involved in heterocycle formation, we consider these genes to be top candidates for laboratory characterization or gene knockouts in the investigation of coelenterazine biosynthesis.},

  abstract = {Fluorescent proteins are widely used to study molecular and cellular events, yet this traditionally relies on delivery of excitation light, which can trigger autofluorescence, photoxicity, and photobleaching, impairing their use in vivo . Accordingly, chemiluminescent light sources such as those generated by luciferases have emerged, as they do not require excitation light. However, current luciferase reporters lack the brightness needed to visualize events in deep tissues. We report the creation of chimeric eGFP-NanoLuc (GpNLuc) and LSSmOrange-NanoLuc (OgNLuc) fusion reporter proteins coined LumiFluors, which combine the benefits of eGFP or LSSmOrange fluorescent proteins with the bright, glow-type bioluminescent light generated by an enhanced small luciferase subunit (NanoLuc) of the deep-sea shrimp Oplophorus gracilirostris . The intramolecular bioluminescence resonance energy transfer that occurs between NanoLuc and the fused fluorophore generates the brightest bioluminescent signal known to date, including improved intensity, sensitivity, and durable spectral properties, thereby dramatically reducing image acquisition times and permitting highly sensitive in vivo imaging. Notably, the self-illuminating and bifunctional nature of these LumiFluor reporters enables greatly improved spatiotemporal monitoring of very small numbers of tumor cells via in vivo optical imaging and also allows the isolation and analyses of single cells by flow cytometry. Thus, LumiFluor reporters are inexpensive, robust, noninvasive tools that allow for markedly improved in vivo optical imaging of tumorigenic processes.

  abstract = {Members of the genus Mycobacterium cause devastating human diseases, including tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can resist some antibiotics because of its durable and impermeable cell envelope. This barrier is assembled from saccharide building blocks not found in mammals, including galactofuranose (Galf). Within the cell envelope, Galf residues are linked together to afford an essential polysaccharide, termed the galactan. The formation of this polymer is catalyzed by the glycosyltransferase GlfT2, a processive carbohydrate polymerase, which generates a sequence-specific polysaccharide with alternating regioisomeric $\beta$(1-5) and $\beta$(1-6) Galf linkages. GlfT2 exhibits high fidelity in linkage formation, as it will terminate polymerization rather than deviate from its linkage pattern. These findings suggest that GlfT2 would prefer an acceptor with a canonical alternating $\beta$(1-5) and $\beta$(1-6) Galf sequence. To test this hypothesis, we devised a synthetic route to assemble oligosaccharides with natural and non-natural sequences. GlfT2 could elongate each of these acceptors, even those with non-natural linkage patterns. These data indicate that the glycosyltransferase is surprisingly promiscuous in its substrate preferences. However, GlfT2 did favor some substrates: it preferentially acted on those in which the lipid-bearing Galf residue was connected to the sequence by a $\beta$(1-6) glycosidic linkage. The finding that the relative positioning of the lipid and the non-reducing end of the acceptor influences substrate selectivity is consistent with a role for the lipid in acceptor binding. The data also suggest that the fidelity of GlfT2 for generating an alternating $\beta$(1-5) and $\beta$(1-6) pattern of Galf residues arises not from preferential substrate binding but during processive elongation. These observations suggest that inhibiting the action of GlfT2 will afford changes in cell wall structure.},

Both classes of enzymes activate fatty acids with ATP to form acyl-adenylate intermediates, but only luciferases can activate and oxidize d-luciferin to emit light.

Bioluminescence can be detected from the purified protein, live Drosophila Schneider 2 cells, and from mammalian cells transfected with CG6178. Thus, the nonluminescent fruit fly possesses an inherent capacity for bioluminescence that is only revealed upon treatment with a xenobiotic molecule. This result expands the scope of bioluminescence and demonstrates that the introduction of a new substrate can unmask latent enzymatic activity that differs significantly from an enzyme's normal function without requiring mutation.},

As such, the identification of agents that selectively inhibit the transdifferentiation process leading to the formation of MFBs represents an attractive approach for the treatment of diverse fibrosis-related diseases. Herein we report the development of a high throughput image-based screen using primary hepatic stellate cells that identified the antifungal drug itraconazole (ITA) as an inhibitor of MFB cell fate in resident fibroblasts derived from multiple murine and human tissues (i.e., lung, liver, heart, and skin). Chemical optimization of ITA led to a molecule (CBR-096-4) devoid of antifungal and human cytochrome P450 inhibitory activity with excellent pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy in rodent models of lung, liver, and skin fibrosis.

  doi = {10.1021/bi400141u},
  abstract = {The origin of luciferases and of bioluminescence is enigmatic. In beetles, luciferases seem to have evolved from AMP-CoA-ligases. How the new oxygenase luminogenic function originated from AMP-ligases leading to luciferases is one of the most challenging mysteries of bioluminescence. Comparison of the cloned luciferase-like enzyme from the nonluminescent Zophobas morio mealworm and beetle luciferases showed that the oxygenase activity may have emerged as a stereoselective oxidative drift with d-luciferin, a substrate that cannot be easily thioesterified to CoA as in the case of the l-isomer. While the overall kcat displayed by beetle luciferases is orders of magnitude greater than that of the luciferase-like enzyme, the respective oxidation rates and quantum yields of bioluminescence are roughly similar, suggesting that the rate constant of the AMP-ligase activity exerted on the new d-luciferin substrate in beetle protoluciferases was the main enzymatic property that suffered optimization during the evolution of luciferases. The luciferase-like enzyme and luciferases boost the rate of luciferyl-adenylate chemiluminescent oxidation by factors of 10(6) and 10(7), respectively, as compared to the substrate spontaneous oxidation in buffer. A similar enhancement of luciferyl-adenylate chemiluminescence is provided by nucleophilic aprotic solvents, implying that the peptide bonds in the luciferin binding site of beetle luciferase could provide a similar catalytically favorable environment. These data suggest that the luciferase-like enzyme and other similar AMP-ligases are potential alternative oxygenases. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of the luciferase-like enzyme and the red light-producing luciferase of Phrixotrix hirtus railroadworm confirm here a critical role for T/S345 in luciferase function. Mutations such as I327T/S in the luciferase-like enzyme, which simultaneously increases luciferase activity and promotes blue shifts in the emission spectrum, could have been critical for evolving functional bioluminescence from red-emitting protoluciferases. Through the combination of I327T/S mutations and N-terminal fusion, the luminescence activity of this enzyme was increased to visible levels, with the development of a totally new orange-emitting luciferase. These results open the possibility of engineering luciferase activity in a set of AMP-CoA-ligases.},

Monoclonal and polyclonal human lymphoid and myeloid leukemia cell lines transduced with firefly luciferase were used for BLI. Kinetics and dynamics of bioluminescence signal were cell line dependent. Luciferase expression decreased significantly over time in polyclonal leukemia cells in vitro. Transplantation of polyclonal luciferase-tagged cells in mice resulted in inconsistent signal intensity. After selection of monoclonal cell populations, luciferase activity was stable, equal kinetic and dynamic of bioluminescence intensity and strong correlation between cell number and light emission in vitro were observed. We obtained an equal development of leukemia burden detected by luciferase activity in NOD-scid-gamma mice after transplantation of monoclonal populations. The use of monoclonal leukemia cells selected for stable and equal luciferase activity is recommended for experiments in vitro and xenograft mouse models. The findings are highly significant for bioluminescence imaging focused on pre-clinical drug development.},

The assay has been designed so that it can be applied to different chemical reactions without changing the components of the three-hybrid system.

It makes use of the fluorescence-quenching properties of 1-methyladenine; removal of the alkyl group results in a $>$10-fold light-up signal. The probe is specific for ALKBH3 over its related homologue ALKBH2 and can be used to identify and measure the effectiveness of enzyme inhibitors. Measurements of the enzyme substrate parameters show that MAQ displays Km and kcat values essentially the same as those of the native substrate. Finally, we show that the probe functions efficiently in cells, allowing imaging and quantitation of ALKBH3 activity by microscopy and flow cytometry.

The expansion of the genetic alphabet with two synthetic unnatural nucleotides that selectively pair to form an unnatural base pair (UBP) would increase the information storage potential of DNA, and semisynthetic organisms (SSOs) that stably harbor this expanded alphabet would thereby have the potential to store and retrieve increased information. Toward this goal, we previously reported that Escherichia coli grown in the presence of the unnatural nucleoside triphosphates dNaMTP and d5SICSTP, and provided with the means to import them via expression of a plasmid-borne nucleoside triphosphate transporter, replicates DNA containing a single dNaM-d5SICS UBP. Although this represented an important proof-of-concept, the nascent SSO grew poorly and, more problematically, required growth under controlled conditions and even then was unable to indefinitely store the unnatural information, which is clearly a prerequisite for true semisynthetic life. Here, to fortify and vivify the nascent SSO, we engineered the transporter, used a more chemically optimized UBP, and harnessed the power of the bacterial immune response by using Cas9 to eliminate DNA that had lost the UBP. The optimized SSO grows robustly, constitutively imports the unnatural triphosphates, and is able to indefinitely retain multiple UBPs in virtually any sequence context. This SSO is thus a form of life that can stably store genetic information using a six-letter, three-base-pair alphabet.},

Indeed, exposure to these treatments may promote ``stemness'' in nonstem cancer cells, which may explain why successful therapeutic reduction of tumor bulk will often fail to produce clinical improvement. Acquisition of stemness involves epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which epithelial cells are transformed into a mesenchymal phenotype characterized by increased capacities for migration, invasiveness, and resistance to apoptosis. EMT may also contribute to metastasis by driving dissemination of mesenchymal CSCs to distant locations, whereupon the CSCs revert to an epithelial phenotype to support metastatic tumor growth. Several different approaches to treatment aimed at overcoming the intrinsic resistance of CSCs to conventional therapies are currently being developed. These include agents targeting tumorigenic pathways, such as JAK2/STAT3 and PI3K/mTOR, and immunotherapies, including vaccines and natural killer cells employed to induce a T cell response....},

Complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligo) primers and the polymerase chain reaction are used to generate two DNA fragments having overlapping ends.

The resulting fusion product is amplified further by PCR. Specific alterations in the nucleotide (nt) sequence can be introduced by incorporating nucleotide changes into the overlapping oligo primers. Using this technique of site-directed mutagenesis, three variants of a mouse major histocompatibility complex class-I gene have been generated, cloned and analyzed. Screening of mutant clones revealed at least a 98\% efficiency of mutagenesis. All clones sequenced contained the desired mutations, and a low frequency of random substitution estimated to occur at approx. 1 in 4000 nt was detected.

  abstract = {The increased importance of in vivo diagnostics has posed new demands for imaging technologies. In that regard, there is a need for imaging molecules capable of expanding the applications of current state-of-the-art imaging in vivo diagnostics. To that end, there is a desire for new reporter molecules capable of providing strong signals, are non-toxic, and can be tailored to diagnose or monitor the progression of a number of diseases. Aequorin is a non-toxic photoprotein that can be used as a sensitive marker for bioluminescence in vivo imaging. The sensitivity of aequorin is due to the fact that bioluminescence is a rare phenomenon in nature and, therefore, it does not suffer from autofluorescence, which contributes to background emission. Emission of bioluminescence in the blue-region of the spectrum by aequorin only occurs when calcium, and its luciferin coelenterazine, are bound to the protein and trigger a biochemical reaction that results in light generation. It is this reaction that endows aequorin with unique characteristics, making it ideally suited for a number of applications in bioanalysis and imaging. Herein we report the site-specific incorporation of non-canonical or non-natural amino acids and several coelenterazine analogues, resulting in a catalog of 72 cysteine-free, aequorin variants which expand the potential applications of these photoproteins by providing several red-shifted mutants better suited to use in vivo. In vivo studies in mouse models using the transparent tissue of the eye confirmed the activity of the aequorin variants incorporating L-4-iodophehylalanine and L-4-methoxyphenylalanine after injection into the eye and topical addition of coelenterazine. The signal also remained localized within the eye. This is the first time that aequorin variants incorporating non-canonical amino acids have shown to be active in vivo and useful as reporters in bioluminescence imaging.},

Increasing the level of residual structure in intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which are overrepresented in these cellular processes, has been shown previously to enhance binding affinities and alter cellular function. Conserved proline residues are commonly found flanking regions of IDPs that become helical upon interacting with a partner protein. Here, we mutate these helix-flanking prolines in p53 and MLL and find opposite effects on binding affinity upon an increase in free IDP helicity. In both cases, changes in affinity were due to alterations in dissociation, not association, rate constants, which is inconsistent with conformational selection mechanisms. We conclude that, contrary to previous suggestions, helix-flanking prolines do not regulate affinity by modulating the rate of complex formation. Instead, they influence binding affinities by controlling the lifetime of the bound complex.},

  abstract = {The in vivo incorporation of non-natural amino acids into specific sites within proteins has become an extremely powerful tool for bio- and protein chemists in recent years. One avenue that has yet to be explored, however, is whether or not the incorporation of non-natural amino acids can tune the color of light emitted by bioluminescent proteins, whose light emission mechanisms are more complex and less well understood than their fluorescent counterparts. Bioluminescent proteins are becoming increasingly important in a variety of research fields, such as in situ imaging and the study of protein-protein interactions in vivo, and an increased spectral variety of bioluminescent reporters is needed for further progress. Thus, herein we report the first successful spectral shifting (44 nm) of a bioluminescent protein, aequorin, via the site-specific incorporation of several non-natural amino acids into an integral amino acid position within the aequorin structure in vivo.},

However, robust, sensitive, and specific methods of detecting this emerging analyte are lacking. ctDNA analysis has unique challenges, since it is imperative to distinguish circulating DNA from normal cells vs mutation-bearing sequences originating from tumors. Here we report the electrochemical detection of mutated ctDNA in samples collected from cancer patients. By developing a strategy relying on the use of DNA clutch probes (DCPs) that render specific sequences of ctDNA accessible, we were able to readout the presence of mutated ctDNA. DCPs prevent reassociation of denatured DNA strands: they make one of the two strands of a dsDNA accessible for hybridization to a probe, and they also deactivate other closely related sequences in solution. DCPs ensure thereby that only mutated sequence...},

  abstract = {The construction of synthetic gene circuits relies on our ability to engineer regulatory architectures that are orthogonal to the host's native regulatory pathways. However, as synthetic gene circuits become larger and more complicated, we are limited by the small number of parts, especially transcription factors, that work well in the context of the circuit. The current repertoire of transcription factors consists of a limited selection of activators and repressors, making the implementation of transcriptional logic a complicated and component-intensive process. To address this, we modified bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP) to create a library of transcriptional AND gates for use in Escherichia coli by first splitting the protein and then mutating the DNA recognition domain of the C-terminal fragment to alter its promoter specificity. We first demonstrate that split T7 RNAP is active in vivo and compare it with full-length enzyme. We then create a library of mutant split T7 RNAPs that have a range of activities when used in combination with a complimentary set of altered T7-specific promoters. Finally, we assay the two-input function of both wild-type and mutant split T7 RNAPs and find that regulated expression of the N- and C-terminal fragments of the split T7 RNAPs creates AND logic in each case. This work demonstrates that mutant split T7 RNAP can be used as a transcriptional AND gate and introduces a unique library of components for use in synthetic gene circuits.},

Due to their role in normal physiology and pathophysiology, both enzymes have been identified as potential drug targets, but few useful inhibitors have been reported. Here, we find that 2-chloroacetamidine irreversibly inhibits both DDAH from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and human PAD4 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, despite the nonoverlapping substrate specificities and low levels of amino acid identity of their catalytic domains. Substrate protection experiments indicate that inactivation occurs by modification at the active site, albeit with modest affinity. Mass spectral analysis demonstrates that irreversible inactivation of DDAH occurs through selective formation of a covalent thioether bond with the active-site Cys249 residue. The mechanism of inactivation by 2-chloroacetamidine is analogous to that of c...},

We aimed to assess BLI efficiency of the new luciferase NanoLuc (Nluc) for glioblastoma cell lines and tumors, including for dual reporter applications of deep brain tumors and systemic metastasis when combined with firefly luciferase (Fluc).

PROCEDURES:U87 cells were genetically modified for constitutive production of either Nluc, Fluc, or both and assayed for luciferase activity and BLI on cell lysates, living cells, subcutaneous tumors, brain tumors, and systemic metastases.

RESULTS:In vitro, light production by Nluc activity is higher than Fluc. In vivo, Nluc allows for tumor detection including for deep brain tumors and systemic metastases.

CONCLUSIONS:Nluc appears to be a useful tool to combine with Fluc for dual imaging in vivo using bioluminescence, allowing for the detection of distinct events in deep tissues within the same organism.},

  volume = {114},
  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1700128114},
  abstract = {The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) orchestrates dynamic recruitment of specific cellular machines during different stages of transcription. Signature phosphorylation patterns of Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 heptapeptide repeats of the CTD engage specific "readers." Whereas phospho-Ser5 and phospho-Ser2 marks are ubiquitous, phospho-Thr4 is reported to only impact specific genes. Here, we identify a role for phospho-Thr4 in transcription termination at noncoding small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes. Quantitative proteomics reveals an interactome of known readers as well as protein complexes that were not known to rely on Thr4 for association with Pol II. The data indicate a key role for Thr4 in engaging the machinery used for transcription elongation and termination. We focus on Rtt103, a protein that binds phospho-Ser2 and phospho-Thr4 marks and facilitates transcription termination at protein-coding genes. To elucidate how Rtt103 engages two distinct CTD modifications that are differentially enriched at noncoding genes, we relied on NMR analysis of Rtt103 in complex with phospho-Thr4- or phospho-Ser2-bearing CTD peptides. The structural data reveal that Rtt103 interacts with phospho-Thr4 in a manner analogous to its interaction with phospho-Ser2-modified CTD. The same set of hydrogen bonds involving either the oxygen on phospho-Thr4 and the hydroxyl on Ser2, or the phosphate on Ser2 and the Thr4 hydroxyl, can be formed by rotation of an arginine side chain, leaving the intermolecular interface otherwise unperturbed. This economy of design enables Rtt103 to engage Pol II at distinct sets of genes with differentially enriched CTD marks.},

We and others have synthesized aminoluciferin analogs that exhibit light emission at longer wavelengths than D-luciferin and have increased affinity for luciferase. However, although these substrates can emit an intense initial burst of light that approaches that of D-luciferin, this is followed by much lower levels of sustained light output.

  abstract = {Bioluminescence using the reporter enzyme firefly luciferase (Fluc) and the substrate luciferin enables non-invasive optical imaging of living animals with extremely high sensitivity. This type of analysis enables studies of gene expression, tumor growth, and cell migration over time in live animals that were previously not possible. However, a major limitation of this system is that Fluc activity is restricted to the intracellular environment, which precludes important applications of in vivo imaging such as antibody labeling, or serum protein monitoring. In order to expand the application of bioluminescence imaging to other enzymes, we characterized a sequential reporter-enzyme luminescence (SRL) technology for the in vivo detection of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity. The substrate is a "caged" D-luciferin conjugate that must first be cleaved by beta-gal before it can be catalyzed by Fluc in the final, light-emitting step. Hence, luminescence is dependent on and correlates with beta-gal activity. A variety of experiments were performed in order to validate the system and explore potential new applications. We were able to visualize non-invasively over time constitutive beta-gal activity in engineered cells, as well as inducible tissue-specific beta-gal expression in transgenic mice. Since beta-gal, unlike Fluc, retains full activity outside of cells, we were able to show that antibodies conjugated to the recombinant beta-gal enzyme could be used to detect and localize endogenous cells and extracellular antigens in vivo. In addition, we developed a low-affinity beta-gal complementation system that enables inducible, reversible protein interactions to be monitored in real time in vivo, for example, sequential responses to agonists and antagonists of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Thus, using SRL, the exquisite luminescent properties of Fluc can be combined with the advantages of another enzyme. Other substrates have been described that extend the scope to endogenous enzymes, such as cytochromes or caspases, potentially enabling additional unprecedented applications.},

  abstract = {Luciferase exhibits a broad range of emitting frequencies. Light emission from the bioluminescence of luciferase makes it an excellent tool for monitoring gene expression, thus the control of its bioluminescence color has great bio-analytical applications. Here I use an elastic network model to examine how the sequence distribution of luciferase is related to bioluminescence multicolor emission. Based on the open and closed forms of crystal structures for luciferase, several computational analysis tools are applied to characterize the functionally relevant dynamical features within luciferase, and probe the dynamical mechanisms underlying the interactions between luciferin (a light-emitting substrate) and luciferase. Perturbation-based correlation analysis is used to identify hot-spot residues that are dynamically coupled to the active site of luciferase, and the results show that the sequence region of subdomain B of luciferase is largely responsible for determining the emitting color of bioluminescence. Moreover, the mode decomposition analysis reveals that the lowest frequency mode is the major contributor to the dynamical couplings between the hot-spot residues and the binding site in luciferase.},

  doi = {10.1039/C6SC03533G},
  abstract = {2-Hydroxyphenylthiazolines are a family of iron-chelating nonribosomal peptide natural products that function as virulence-conferring siderophores in various Gram-negative bacteria. They have also been reported as metabolites of Gram-positive Streptomyces species. Transcriptional analyses of Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 10712 revealed that its genome contains a putative 2-hydroxyphenylthiazoline biosynthetic gene cluster. Heterologous expression of the gene cluster in Streptomyces coelicolor M1152 showed that the mono- and dimethylated derivatives, thiazostatin and watasemycin, respectively, of the well known 2-hydroxyphenylthiazoline pyochelin are two of its metabolic products. In addition, isopyochelin, a novel isomer of pyochelin containing a C-methylated thiazolidine, was identified as a third metabolic product of the cluster. Metabolites with molecular formulae corresponding to aerugine and pulicatins A/B were also detected. The structure and stereochemistry of isopyochelin were confirmed by comparison with synthetic standards. The role of two genes in the cluster encoding homologues of PchK, which is proposed to catalyse thiazoline reduction in the biosynthesis of enantiopyochelin in Pseudomonas protegens, was investigated. One was required for the production of all the metabolic products of the cluster, whereas the other appears not to be involved in the biosynthesis of any of them. Deletion of a gene in the cluster encoding a type B radical-SAM methylase homolouge abolished the production of watasemycin, but not thiazostatin or isopyochelin. Feeding of thiazostatin to the mutant lacking the functional PchK homologue resulted in complete conversion to watasemycin, demonstrating that thiazoline C-methylation by the type B radical-SAM methylase homologue is the final step in watasemycin biosynthesis.},

A relatively small number of luciferases are available for imaging studies, substantially limiting the ability to image multiple molecular and cellular events, as done commonly with fluorescence imaging. To advance dual reporter bioluminescence molecular imaging, we tested a recently developed, adenosine triphosphate\textendash{}independent luciferase enzyme from Oplophorus gracilirostris (NanoLuc [NL]) as a reporter for animal imaging. We demonstrated that NL could be imaged in superficial and deep tissues in living mice, although the detection of NL in deep tissues was limited by emission of predominantly blue light by this enzyme. Changes in bioluminescence from NL over time could be used to quantify tumor growth, and secreted NL was detectable in small volumes of serum. We combined NL and firefly luciferase reporters to quantify two key steps in transforming growth factor $\beta$ signaling in intact cells and living mice, establishing a novel dual luciferase imaging strategy for quantifying signal transduction and drug targeting. Our results establish NL as a new reporter for bioluminescence imaging studies in intact cells and living mice that will expand imaging of signal transduction in normal physiology, disease, and drug development.},

With the advent of copious, relevant structural information, judicious mechanistic studies and the use of accessible computational methods in protein design coupled with new synthetic methods for building biomacromolecules, we can envisage a `new dawn' that will allow us to build de novo metalloenzymes that move beyond mono-metal centres. In particular, we highlight the need for systems that approach the multi-centred clusters that have evolved to couple electron shuttling with catalysis. Such hybrids may be viewed as exciting mid-points between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts which also exploit the primary benefits of biocatalysis.},

Qrr1-5 use four different regulatory mechanisms to control the expression of $\sim$ 20 mRNA targets. Little is known about the roles individual nucleotides play in mRNA target selection, in determining regulatory mechanism, or in defining Qrr potency and dynamics of target regulation. To identify the nucleotides vital for Qrr function, we developed a method we call RSort-Seq that combines saturating mutagenesis, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, high-throughput sequencing, and mutual information theory to explore the role that every nucleotide in Qrr4 plays in regulation of two mRNA targets, luxR and luxO. Companion biochemical assays allowed us to assign specific regulatory functions/underlying molecular mechanisms to each important base. This strategy yielded a regional map of nucleotides in Qrr4 vital for stability, Hfq interaction, stem-loop formation, and base pairing to both luxR and luxO, to luxR only, and to luxO only. In terms of nucleotides critical for sRNA function, the RSort-Seq analysis provided strikingly different results from those predicted by commonly used regulatory RNA-folding algorithms. This approach is applicable to any RNA-RNA interaction, including sRNAs in other bacteria and regulatory RNAs in higher organisms.},

  abstract = {Bacterial glycans contain rare, exclusively bacterial monosaccharides that are frequently linked to pathogenesis and essentially absent from human cells. Therefore, bacterial glycans are intriguing molecular targets. However, systematic discovery of bacterial glycoproteins is hampered by the presence of rare deoxy amino sugars, which are refractory to traditional glycan-binding reagents. Thus, the development of chemical tools that label bacterial glycans is a crucial step toward discovering and targeting these biomolecules. Here, we explore the extent to which metabolic glycan labeling facilitates the studying and targeting of glycoproteins in a range of pathogenic and symbiotic bacterial strains. We began with an azide-containing analog of the naturally abundant monosaccharide N-acetylglucosamine and discovered that it is not broadly incorporated into bacterial glycans, thus revealing a need for additional azidosugar substrates to broaden the utility of metabolic glycan labeling in bacteria. Therefore, we designed and synthesized analogs of the rare deoxy amino d-sugars N-acetylfucosamine, bacillosamine, and 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxygalactose and established that these analogs are differentially incorporated into glycan-containing structures in a range of pathogenic and symbiotic bacterial species. Further application of these analogs will refine our knowledge of the glycan repertoire in diverse bacteria and may find utility in treating a variety of infectious diseases with selectivity.},

Conspicuously missing from this class of therapies are traditional small-molecule drugs, which have previously served as the backbone of targeted cancer therapies. Modulating the immune system through a small-molecule approach offers several unique advantages that are complementary to, and potentially synergistic with, biologic modalities. This Review highlights immuno-oncology pathways and mechanisms that can be best or solely targeted by small-molecule medicines.

  abstract = {The total chemical synthesis of proteins has great potential for increasing our understanding of the molecular basis of protein function. The introduction of native chemical ligation techniques to join unprotected peptides next to a cysteine residue has greatly facilitated the synthesis of proteins of moderate size. Here, we describe a straightforward methodology that has enabled us to rapidly analyze the compatibility of the native chemical ligation strategy for X-Cys ligation sites, where X is any of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. The simplified methodology avoids the necessity of specific amino acid thioester linkers or alkylation of C-terminal thioacid peptides. Experiments using matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization MS analysis of combinatorial ligations of LYRAX-C-terminal thioester peptides to the peptide CRANK show that all 20 amino acids are suitable for ligation, with Val, Ile, and Pro representing less favorable choices because of slow ligation rates. To illustrate the method's utility, two 124-aa proteins were manually synthesized by using a three-step, four-piece ligation to yield a fully active human secretory phospholipase A(2) and a catalytically inactive analog. The combination of flexibility in design with general access because of simplified methodology broadens the applicability and versatility of chemical protein synthesis.},

Distinct folding steps correlated with the formation of key secondary or tertiary structures and with ligand binding. Adenine-induced stabilization of the weakest helix in the aptamer, the mechanical switch underlying regulatory action, was observed directly.

  abstract = {Chemokine CXCL12 (CXC chemokine ligand 12) signalling through CXCR (CXC chemokine receptor) 4 and CXCR7 has essential functions in development and underlies diseases including cancer, atherosclerosis and autoimmunity. Chemokines may form homodimers that regulate receptor binding and signalling, but previous studies with synthetic CXCL12 have produced conflicting evidence for homodimerization. We used bioluminescence imaging with GL ( Gaussia luciferase) fusions to investigate dimerization of CXCL12 secreted from mammalian cells. Using column chromatography and GL complementation, we established that CXCL12 was secreted from mammalian cells as both monomers and dimers. Secreted CXCL12 also formed homodimers in the extracellular space. Monomeric CXCL12 preferentially activated CXCR4 signalling through G$\alpha$i and Akt, whereas dimeric CXCL12 more effectively promoted recruitment of $\beta$-arrestin 2 to CXCR4 and chemotaxis of CXCR4-expressing breast cancer cells. We also showed that CXCR7 preferentially sequestered monomeric CXCL12 from the extracellular space and had minimal effects on dimeric CXCL12 in cell-based assays and an orthotopic tumour xenograft model of human breast cancer. These studies establish that CXCL12 secreted from mammalian cells forms homodimers under physiological conditions. Since monomeric and dimeric CXCL12 have distinct effects on cell signalling and function, our results have important implications for ongoing efforts to target CXCL12 pathways for therapy.

  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1410776112},
  abstract = {Developing tissues contain motile populations of cells that can self-organize into spatially ordered tissues based on differences in their interfacial surface energies. However, it is unclear how self-organization by this mechanism remains robust when interfacial energies become heterogeneous in either time or space. The ducts and acini of the human mammary gland are prototypical heterogeneous and dynamic tissues comprising two concentrically arranged cell types. To investigate the consequences of cellular heterogeneity and plasticity on cell positioning in the mammary gland, we reconstituted its self-organization from aggregates of primary cells in vitro. We find that self-organization is dominated by the interfacial energy of the tissue-ECM boundary, rather than by differential homo- and heterotypic energies of cell-cell interaction. Surprisingly, interactions with the tissue-ECM boundary are binary, in that only one cell type interacts appreciably with the boundary. Using mathematical modeling and cell-type-specific knockdown of key regulators of cell-cell cohesion, we show that this strategy of self-organization is robust to severe perturbations affecting cell-cell contact formation. We also find that this mechanism of self-organization is conserved in the human prostate. Therefore, a binary interfacial interaction with the tissue boundary provides a flexible and generalizable strategy for forming and maintaining the structure of two-component tissues that exhibit abundant heterogeneity and plasticity. Our model also predicts that mutations affecting binary cell-ECM interactions are catastrophic and could contribute to loss of tissue architecture in diseases such as breast cancer.},

Regulatory roles of proteases include their hormone-like role in triggering G protein-coupled signaling (Protease-Activated-Receptors); their role in shedding of ligands such as EGF, Notch and Fas; and their role in signaling events that lead to apoptotic cell death. Dysregulated activation of apoptosis by the caspase family of proteases has been linked to diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity and inflammation. In an effort to better understand the role of proteases in health and disease, a luciferase biosensor is described which can quantitatively report proteolytic activity in live cells and mouse models. The biosensor, hereafter referred to as GloSensor Caspase 3/7 has a robust signal to noise (50-100 fold) and dynamic range such that it can be used to screen for pharmacologically active compounds in high throughput campaigns as well as to study cell signaling in rare cell populations such as isolated cancer stem cells. The biosensor can also be used in the context of genetically engineered mouse models of human disease wherein conditional expression using the Cre/loxP technology can be implemented to investigate the role of a specific protease in living subjects. While the regulation of apoptosis by caspase's was used as an example in these studies, biosensors to study additional proteases involved in the regulation of normal and pathological cellular processes can be designed using the concepts presented herein.},

However, ribosomal incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) by means of engineered aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) often proceeds with significantly reduced efficiency compared to sense codon translation. Here, we report the implementation of a versatile platform for the development of engineered aaRSs with enhanced efficiency in mediating ncAA incorporation by amber stop codon suppression. This system integrates a white/blue colony screen with a plate-based colorimetric assay, thereby combining high-throughput capabilities with reliable and quantitative measurement of aaRS-dependent ncAA incorporation efficiency. This two-tier functional screening system was successfully applied to obtain a pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS) variant (CrtK-RS(4.1)) with significantly improved efficiency (+250-370\,\%) for mediating the incorporation of N$\epsilon$ -crotonyl-lysine and other lysine analogues of relevance for the study of protein post-translational modifications into a target protein. Interestingly, the beneficial mutations accumulated by CrtK-RS(4.1) were found to localize within the noncatalytic N-terminal domain of the enzyme and could be transferred to another PylRS variant, improving the ability of the variant to incorporate its corresponding ncAA substrate. This work introduces an efficient platform for the improvement of aaRSs that could be readily extended to other members of this enzyme family and/or other target ncAAs.},

  abstract = {The network of activator protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that underpin transcription initiation is poorly defined, particularly in the cellular context. The transient nature of these contacts and the often low abundance of the participants present significant experimental hurdles. Through the coupling of in vivo covalent chemical capture and shotgun LC-MS/MS (MuDPIT) analysis, we can trap the PPIs of transcriptional activators in a cellular setting and identify the binding partners in an unbiased fashion. Using this approach, we discover that the prototypical activators Gal4 and VP16 target the Snf1 (AMPK) kinase complex via direct interactions with both the core enzymatic subunit Snf1 and the exchangeable subunit Gal83. Further, we use a tandem reversible formaldehyde and irreversible covalent chemical capture approach (TRIC) to capture the Gal4-Snf1 interaction at the Gal1 promoter in live yeast. Together, these data support a critical role for activator PPIs in both the recruitment and positioning of important enzymatic complexes at a gene promoter and represent a technical advancement in the discovery of new cellular binding targets of transcriptional activators.},

Typically, hydrotropes are amphiphilic molecules and differ from classical surfactants in that they have low cooperativity of aggregation and work at molar concentrations. Here, we show that adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has properties of a biological hydrotrope. It can both prevent the formation of and dissolve previously formed protein aggregates. This chemical property is manifested at physiological concentrations between 5 and 10 millimolar. Therefore, in addition to being an energy source for biological reactions, for which micromolar concentrations are sufficient, we propose that millimolar concentrations of ATP may act to keep proteins soluble. This may in part explain why ATP is maintained in such high concentrations in cells.},

Despite its popularity, bioluminescence has long been hindered by a lack of distinguishable probes. Here we present a method to rapidly identify new substrate-selective luciferases for multicomponent imaging. Our strategy relies on parallel screening of luciferin analogues with panels of mutant enzymes. The compiled data set is then analyzed in silico to uncover mutually orthogonal sets. Using this approach, we screened 159 mutant enzymes with 12 luciferins. Thousands of orthogonal pairs were revealed with sufficient selectivity for use in biological environments. Over 100 pairs were validated in vitro, and three were applied in cell and animal models. The parallel screening method is both generalizable and scalable and will streamline the search for larger collections of orthogonal probes.},

  volume = {3},

  abstract = {We present a simple method for rapid and automatic characterization of lymphocyte migration from time-lapse fluorescence microscopy data. Time-lapse imaging of natural killer (NK) cells in vitro and in situ, both showed that individual cells transiently alter their migration behavior. Typically, NK cells showed periods of high motility, interrupted by transient periods of slow migration or almost complete arrests. Analysis of in vitro data showed that these periods frequently coincided with contacts with target cells, sometimes leading to target cell lysis. However, NK cells were also commonly observed to stop independently of contact with other cells. In order to objectively characterize the migration of NK cells, we implemented a simple method to discriminate when NK cells stop or have low motilities, have periods of directed migration or undergo random movement. This was achieved using a sliding window approach and evaluating the mean squared displacement (MSD) to assess the migration coefficient and MSD curvature along trajectories from individual NK cells over time. The method presented here can be used to quickly and quantitatively assess the dynamics of individual cells as well as heterogeneity within ensembles. Furthermore, it may also be used as a tool to automatically detect transient stops due to the formation of immune synapses, cell division or cell death. We show that this could be particularly useful for analysis of in situ time-lapse fluorescence imaging data where most cells, as well as the extracellular matrix, are usually unlabelled and thus invisible.},

  doi = {10.1038/nrc3742},
  abstract = {Our current view on cancer hallmarks is mostly based on techniques that provide a snapshot of a large population of cells, whereas intravital microscopy (IVM) provides a view on dynamic subpopulations of both tumour and stromal cells in living animals. Imaging windows allow longitudinal studies on optically inaccessible tumour tissue during consecutive imaging sessions. Most imaging windows are used to study primary tumours, but some allow for the examination of metastases. To acquire high-quality fluorescent images deep inside animals, multiphoton microscopes are frequently used. The advantages of multiphoton microscopes include deep tissue penetration, reduced phototoxicity and reduced bleaching, optical sectioning and reduced tissue-mediated absorption and scattering. Several contrast agents and fluorescent biosensors are available to intravitally image the activation status of multiple proteins and signalling pathways in individual cells, deep inside animals. IVM demonstrated a paradoxical role of the tumour vasculature by showing that, in some cases, leaky vessels can prevent the delivery of therapeutic agents owing to elevated interstitial fluid pressure but, in other cases, leaky vessels can support the delivery of drugs. Intravital imaging is a powerful tool to investigate the paradoxical role of the immune system on tumour growth and could help to clarify the best approach to stimulate the immune destruction of tumours and prevent pro-tumorigenic immune effects. Intravital lineage tracing can uncover the dynamic nature of cancer stem cells and provides information on the history and fate of these cells. IVM has the potential to identify the targets of cancer therapeutics and validate the in vivo mode of actions of these drugs, for example, those that inhibit proliferation or promote cell death. Combining fluorescence IVM techniques with various imaging and conventional biochemical techniques holds great promise to gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the hallmarks of cancer.},

  abstract = {Neurexin and neuroligin are transmembrane adhesion proteins that play an important role in organizing the neuronal synaptic cleft. Our lab previously reported a method for imaging the trans-synaptic binding of neurexin and neuroligin called BLINC (Biotin Labeling of INtercellular Contacts). In BLINC, biotin ligase (BirA) is fused to one protein while its 15-amino acid acceptor peptide substrate (AP) is fused to the binding partner. When the two fusion proteins interact across cellular junctions, BirA catalyzes the site-specific biotinylation of AP, which can be read out by staining with streptavidin-fluorophore conjugates. Here, we report that BLINC in neurons cannot be reproduced using the reporter constructs and labeling protocol previously described. We uncover the technical reasons for the lack of reproducibilty and then re-design the BLINC reporters and labeling protocol to achieve neurexin-neuroligin BLINC imaging in neuron cultures. In addition, we introduce a new method, based on lipoic acid ligase instead of biotin ligase, to image trans-cellular neurexin-neuroligin interactions in human embryonic kidney cells and in neuron cultures. This method, called ID-PRIME for Interaction-Dependent PRobe Incorporation Mediated by Enzymes, is more robust than BLINC due to higher surface expression of lipoic acid ligase fusion constructs, gives stronger and more localized labeling, and is more versatile than BLINC in terms of signal readout. ID-PRIME expands the toolkit of methods available to study trans-cellular protein-protein interactions in living systems.},

  abstract = {Bioluminescence imaging with luciferase-luciferin pairs is widely used in biomedical research. Several luciferases have been identified in nature, and many have been adapted for tracking cells in whole animals. Unfortunately, the optimal luciferases for imaging in vivo utilize the same substrate and therefore cannot easily differentiate multiple cell types in a single subject. To develop a broader set of distinguishable probes, we crafted custom luciferins that can be selectively processed by engineered luciferases. Libraries of mutant enzymes were iteratively screened with sterically modified luciferins, and orthogonal enzyme-substrate "hits" were identified. These tools produced light when complementary enzyme-substrate partners interacted both in vitro and in cultured cell models. Based on their selectivity, these designer pairs will bolster multicomponent imaging and enable the direct interrogation of cell networks not currently possible with existing tools. Our screening platform is also general and will expedite the identification of more unique luciferases and luciferins, further expanding the bioluminescence toolkit.},

We herein report the directed evolution and characterization of an orthogonal NA kinase for 3'-deoxythymidine (ddT), using a new FACS-based screening protocol in combination with a fluorescent analog of ddT. Four rounds of random mutagenesis and DNA shuffling of Drosophila melanogaster 2'-deoxynucleoside kinase, followed by FACS analysis, yielded an orthogonal ddT kinase with a 6-fold higher activity for the NA and a 20-fold k(cat)/K(M) preference for ddT over thymidine, an overall 10,000-fold change in substrate specificity. The contributions of individual amino acid substitutions in the ddT kinase were evaluated by reverse engineering, enabling a detailed structure-function analysis to rationalize the observed changes in performance. Based on our results, kinase engineering with fluorescent NAs and FACS should prove a highly versatile method for evolving selective kinase:NA pairs and for studying fundamental aspects of the structure-function relationship in dNKs.},

  abstract = {Firefly luciferase is widely used in a number of areas of biotechnology and molecular biology. However, rapid inactivation of wild-type (WT) luciferases at elevated temperatures often hampers their application. A simple non-lethal in vivo screening scheme was used to identify thermostable mutants of luciferase in Escherichia coli colonies. This scheme allowed carrying out each cycle of mutagenesis in a rapid and efficient manner. Four rounds of directed evolution were conducted on a part of the gene coding for amino acid residues 130-390 of Luciola mingrelica luciferase. The resultant mutant designated 4TS had a half-life of 10 h at 42$^\circ$C, which is 65-fold higher compared with the WT luciferase. Moreover, the mutant 4TS showed a 1.9-fold increase in specific activity, 5.7-fold reduction of K(m) for ATP and a higher-temperature optimum compared with the WT enzyme. 4TS contains eight mutations, four~of which are suggested to be mainly responsible for the enhancement of thermostability: R211L, A217V, E356K and S364C. Thus, directed evolution with non-lethal colony screening for in vivo bioluminescence activity proved to be an effective and efficient approach for increasing thermal stability of luciferase while retaining high catalytic activity.},

Using site-directed mutagenesis, we made changes at all of these residues and report here the characterization of the corresponding expressed and purified proteins. Of the 15 residues studied, 12 had a significantly ($>$or=4-fold K(m) difference) altered binding affinity for luciferin and seven residues, spanning the primary sequence region Arg218-Ala348, had substantially ($>$or=30 nm) red-shifted bioluminescence emission maxima when mutated. We report here an interpretation of the roles of the mutated residues in substrate binding and bioluminescence color determination. The results of this study generally substantiate the accuracy of our model and provide the foundation for future experiments designed to alter the substrate specificity of firefly luciferase.},

Because diversity is created at the codon level, codon redundancy is a crucial factor determining the necessary effort for library screening. Additionally, due to the probabilistic nature of the sampling process, oversampling is required to ensure library completeness as well as a high probability to encounter all unique variants. Our trick employs a special mixture of three primers, creating a degeneracy of 22 unique codons coding for the 20 canonical amino acids. Therefore, codon redundancy and subsequent screening effort is significantly reduced, and a balanced distribution of codon per amino acid is achieved, as demonstrated exemplarily for a library of cyclohexanone monooxygenase. We show that this strategy is suitable for any saturation mutagenesis methodology to generate less-redundant libraries.},

Due to this, high BRET efficiency ratios of $\sim$5 were obtained.

To extend the utility of surface borrowing to include potential applications in synthetic biology, we set out to create an 'orthogonal' RNA-targeting system, one in which all components are foreign to the cell.

  abstract = {Light emission from the North American firefly Photinus pyralis, which emits yellow-green (557-nm) light, is widely believed to be the most efficient bioluminescence system known, making this luciferase an excellent tool for monitoring gene expression. Here, we present studies leading to the production of a set of red- and green-emitting luciferase mutants with bioluminescent properties suitable for expanding the use of the P. pyralis system to dual-color reporter assays, biosensor measurements with internal controls, and imaging techniques. Using a combination of mutagenesis methods, we determined that the Ser284Thr mutation was sufficient to create an excellent red-emitting luciferase with a bioluminescence maximum of 615 nm, a narrow emission bandwidth, and favorable kinetic properties. Also, we developed a luciferase, containing the changes Val241Ile, Gly246Ala, and Phe250Ser, whose emission maximum was blue-shifted to 549 nm, providing a set of enzymes whose bioluminescence maxima were separated by 66 nm. Model studies demonstrated that in assays using a set of optical filters, the luciferases could be detected at the attomole level and seven orders of magnitude higher. In addition, in the presence of the Ser284Thr enzyme serving as a control, green light emission could be measured over a 10,000-fold range. The results presented here with the P. pyralis mutants provide evidence that simultaneous multiple analyte assay development is feasible with these novel proteins that require only a single substrate.},

  abstract = {The discovery of light-inducible protein-protein interactions has allowed for the spatial and temporal control of a variety of biological processes. To be effective, a photodimerizer should have several characteristics: it should show a large change in binding affinity upon light stimulation, it should not cross-react with other molecules in the cell, and it should be easily used in a variety of organisms to recruit proteins of interest to each other. To create a switch that meets these criteria we have embedded the bacterial SsrA peptide in the C-terminal helix of a naturally occurring photoswitch, the light-oxygen-voltage 2 (LOV2) domain from Avena sativa. In the dark the SsrA peptide is sterically blocked from binding its natural binding partner, SspB. When activated with blue light, the C-terminal helix of the LOV2 domain undocks from the protein, allowing the SsrA peptide to bind SspB. Without optimization, the switch exhibited a twofold change in binding affinity for SspB with light stimulation. Here, we describe the use of computational protein design, phage display, and high-throughput binding assays to create an improved light inducible dimer (iLID) that changes its affinity for SspB by over 50-fold with light stimulation. A crystal structure of iLID shows a critical interaction between the surface of the LOV2 domain and a phenylalanine engineered to more tightly pin the SsrA peptide against the LOV2 domain in the dark. We demonstrate the functional utility of the switch through light-mediated subcellular localization in mammalian cell culture and reversible control of small GTPase signaling.},

  volume = {440},
  doi = {10.1038/nature04542},
  abstract = {Fireflies communicate with each other by emitting yellow-green to yellow-orange brilliant light. The bioluminescence reaction, which uses luciferin, Mg-ATP and molecular oxygen to yield an electronically excited oxyluciferin species, is carried out by the enzyme luciferase. Visible light is emitted during relaxation of excited oxyluciferin to its ground state. The high quantum yield of the luciferin/luciferase reaction and the change in bioluminescence colour caused by subtle structural differences in luciferase have attracted much research interest. In fact, a single amino acid substitution in luciferase changes the emission colour from yellow-green to red. Although the crystal structure of luciferase from the North American firefly (Photinus pyralis) has been described, the detailed mechanism for the bioluminescence colour change is still unclear. Here we report the crystal structures of wild-type and red mutant (S286N) luciferases from the Japanese Genji-botaru (Luciola cruciata) in complex with a high-energy intermediate analogue, 5'-O-[N-(dehydroluciferyl)-sulfamoyl]adenosine (DLSA). Comparing these structures to those of the wild-type luciferase complexed with AMP plus oxyluciferin (products) reveals a significant conformational change in the wild-type enzyme but not in the red mutant. This conformational change involves movement of the hydrophobic side chain of Ile 288 towards the benzothiazole ring of DLSA. Our results indicate that the degree of molecular rigidity of the excited state of oxyluciferin, which is controlled by a transient movement of Ile 288, determines the colour of bioluminescence during the emission reaction.},

We report a method which uses the instability of the adducts to our advantage in a prodrug activation strategy. The reaction of trans-cyclooctenol (TCO-OH) with a model prodrug resulted in a rapid 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with second-order rates of 0.017 M-1 s-1 and 0.027 M-1 s-1 for the equatorial and axial isomers, respectively, resulting in release of the active compound. 1H NMR studies showed that activation proceeded via a triazoline and imine, both of which are rapidly hydrolyzed to release the model drug. Cytotoxicity of a doxorubicin prodrug was restored in vitro upon activation with TCO-OH, while with cis-cyclooctenol (CCO-OH) no activation was observed. The data also demonstrates the potential of this reaction in organic synthesis as a mild orthogonal protecting group strategy for amino and hydroxyl groups.},

Here, for the first time, the cellular uptake kinetics of eight well-established CPPs is compared in HeLa pLuc 705 cells using a recently published releasable luciferin assay. Using this assay, the kinetic behavior of cytosolic entry of these luciferin-CPP conjugates are registered in real time. Our data reveal that the uptake rate of CPPs reaches its maximum either in seconds or in tens of minutes, depending on the CPP used. Tat and higher concentrations of MAP and TP10 display fast internalization profiles that resemble the kinetic profile of membrane-permeable free luciferin.

  abstract = {ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a group of transmembrane proteins that maintain chemical homeostasis through efflux of compounds out of organelles and cells. Among other functions, ABC transporters play a key role in protecting the brain parenchyma by efflux of xenobiotics from capillary endothelial cells at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). They also prevent the entry of therapeutic drugs at the BBB, thereby limiting their efficacy. One of the key transporters playing this role is ABCG2. Although other ABC transporters can be studied through various imaging modalities, no specific probe exists for imaging ABCG2 function in vivo. Here we show that D-luciferin, the endogenous substrate of firefly luciferase, is a specific substrate for ABCG2. We hypothesized that ABCG2 function at the BBB could be evaluated by using bioluminescence imaging in transgenic mice expressing firefly luciferase in the brain. Bioluminescence signal in the brain of mice increased with coadministration of the ABCG2 inhibitors Ko143, gefitinib, and nilotinib, but not an ABCB1 inhibitor. This method for imaging ABCG2 function at the BBB will facilitate understanding of the function and pharmacokinetic inhibition of this transporter.},

However, few studies have addressed the trafficking and in vivo behavior of NK cells in murine models of bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We investigated NK cell trafficking and survival following allogeneic and syngeneic BMT using a novel bioluminescence-based imaging strategy. Transplantation of luciferase-expressing NK cells revealed CD62L-mediated trafficking to lymphoid organs and trafficking to GVHD target tissues, as evidenced by in vivo and ex vivo bioluminescence imaging. The NK cells persisted for $\sim$4 wk after transplantation in allogeneic recipients, but were not detectable in syngeneic recipients. CFSE-labeling studies showed extensive NK cell proliferation in vivo. Transplanted NK cells up-regulated molecules necessary for homing to the lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, yet did not cause clinical GVHD. This expansion and tissue-specific homing was not solely due to the conditioning regimen, as NK cells proliferated and reached lymphoid and GVHD target tissue in unconditioned allogeneic RAG2-/- $\gamma$-chain-/- recipients. IL-2 enhanced expansion and antitumor activity of NK cells. These results provide significant insight into the behavior and potential therapeutic impact of NK cells in BMT.},

In one case, an outstanding BRET ratio of 34.0 was achieved emphasizing the importance of selective labeling with fluorescent dyes and the efficiency provided by the intramolecular BRET process.

Identification of these factors is critical for understanding the infection process. We report a powerful and versatile approach to the selective labeling and identification of secreted pathogen proteins. Selective labeling of microbial proteins is accomplished via translational incorporation of azidonorleucine (Anl), a methionine surrogate that requires a mutant form of the methionyl-tRNA synthetase for activation. Secreted pathogen proteins containing Anl can be tagged by azide-alkyne cycloaddition and enriched by affinity purification. Application of the method to analysis of the type III secretion system of the human pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica enabled efficient identification of secreted proteins, identification of distinct secretion profiles for intracellular and extracellular bacteria, and determination of the order of substrate injection into host cells. This approach should be widely useful for the identification of virulence factors in microbial pathogens and the development of potential new targets for antimicrobial therapy.},

  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1610541113},
  abstract = {How hydrophobicity (HY) drives protein folding is studied. The 1971 Nozaki-Tanford method of measuring HY is modified to use gases as solutes, not crystals, and this makes the method easy to use. Alkanes are found to be much more hydrophobic than rare gases, and the two different kinds of HY are termed intrinsic (rare gases) and extrinsic (alkanes). The HY values of rare gases are proportional to solvent-accessible surface area (ASA), whereas the HY values of alkanes depend on special hydration shells. Earlier work showed that hydration shells produce the hydration energetics of alkanes. Evidence is given here that the transfer energetics of alkanes to cyclohexane [Wolfenden R, Lewis CA, Jr, Yuan Y, Carter CW, Jr (2015) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 112(24):7484-7488] measure the release of these shells. Alkane shells are stabilized importantly by van der Waals interactions between alkane carbon and water oxygen atoms. Thus, rare gases cannot form this type of shell. The very short (approximately picoseconds) lifetime of the van der Waals interaction probably explains why NMR efforts to detect alkane hydration shells have failed. The close similarity between the sizes of the opposing energetics for forming or releasing alkane shells confirms the presence of these shells on alkanes and supports Kauzmann's 1959 mechanism of protein folding. A space-filling model is given for the hydration shells on linear alkanes. The model reproduces the n values of Jorgensen et al. [Jorgensen WL, Gao J, Ravimohan C (1985) J Phys Chem 89:3470-3473] for the number of waters in alkane hydration shells.},

The optical contamination-free feature was exemplified with the luciferase-specific CTZ analogues, which illuminated anti-estrogenic and rapamycin activities in a mixture of optical probes. This unique bioluminescence platform has great potential for specific and high throughput imaging of multiple optical readouts in bioassays without optical contamination.},

Here, we report the development of antibody-sialidase conjugates that enhance tumor cell susceptibility to antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) by selective desialylation of the tumor cell glycocalyx. We chemically fused a recombinant sialidase to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific antibody trastuzumab through a C-terminal aldehyde tag. The antibody-sialidase conjugate desialylated tumor cells in a HER2-dependent manner, reduced binding by natural killer (NK) cell inhibitory sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin (Siglec) receptors, and enhanced binding to the NK-activating receptor natural killer group 2D (NKG2D). Sialidase conjugation to trastuzumab enhanced ADCC against tumor cells expressing moderate levels of HER2, suggesting a therapeutic strategy for cancer patients with lower HER2 levels or inherent trastuzumab resistance. Precision glycocalyx editing with antibody-enzyme conjugates is therefore a promising avenue for cancer immune therapy.},

Due to the major challenges associated with total- and semi-synthesis, bioengineering approaches have been developed to increase yields and generate modified peptides with improved physicochemical properties or altered bioactivity. Here we review the major advances that have been made over the last decade in engineering the biosynthesis of nonribosomal peptides. Structural diversity has been introduced by the modification of enzymes required for the supply of precursors or by heterologous expression of tailoring enzymes. The modularity of nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly lines further supports module or domain swapping methodologies to achieve changes in the amino acid sequence of nonribosomal peptides. We also review the new synthetic biology technologies promising to speed up the process, enabling the creation and optimisation of many more assembly lines for heterologous expression, offering new opportunities for engineering the biosynthesis of novel nonribosomal peptides.},

The two proteins are connected by a decapeptide containing a protease recognition site specific for factor Xa, thrombin, or caspase 3. The rates of protease cleavage of the fusion protein substrates were monitored by recording emission spectra and plotting the change in peak ratios over time. Detection limits of 0.41nM for caspase 3, 1.0nM for thrombin, and 58nM for factor Xa were realized with a scanning fluorometer.

We have confirmed the generally held notions that the oxidation step is initiated by formation of a carbanion intermediate and that a hydroperoxide (anion) is involved. Additionally, structural evidence is presented that accounts for the delivery of oxygen to the substrate reaction site. Herein, we report key convincing spectroscopic evidence of the participation of superoxide anion in a related chemical model reaction that supports a single electron-transfer pathway for the critical oxidative process. This mechanism may be a common feature of bioluminescence processes in which light is produced by an enzyme in the absence of cofactors.},

(2001) Science 293, 58-59 and Molema, G. \& Meijer, D. K. F., eds. (2001) Drug Targeting (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany)]. We describe a bipartite drug-delivery system that exploits (I) endogenous carbohydrate-to-lectin binding to localize glycosylated enzyme conjugates to specific, predetermined cell types followed by (II) administration of a prodrug activated by that predelivered enzyme at the desired site. The carbohydrate structure of an alpha-L-rhamnopyranosidase enzyme was specifically engineered through enzymatic deglycosylation and chemical reglycosylation. Combined in vivo and in vitro techniques (gamma scintigraphy, microautoradiography and confocal microscopy) determined organ and cellular localization and demonstrated successful activation of alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside prodrug. Ligand competition experiments revealed enhanced, specific localization by endocytosis and a strongly carbohydrate-dependent, 60-fold increase in selectivity toward target cell hepatocytes that generated a $>$30-fold increase (from 0.02 to 0.66 mg) in protein delivered. Furthermore, glycosylation engineering enhanced the serum-uptake rate and enzyme stability. This created enzyme activity (0.2 units in hepatocytes) for prodrug therapy, the target of which was switched simply by sugar-type alteration. The therapeutic effectiveness of lectin-directed enzyme-activated prodrug therapy was shown through the construction of the prodrug of doxorubicin, Rha-DOX, and its application to reduce tumor burden in a hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) disease model.},

  abstract = {An 11-residue peptide with the sequence DSLEFIASKLA was identified from a genomic library of Bacillus subtilis by phage display as an efficient substrate for Sfp phosphopantetheinyl transferase-catalyzed protein labeling by small molecule-CoA conjugates. We name this peptide the "ybbR tag," because part of its sequence is derived from the ybbR ORF in the B. subtilis genome. The site of Sfp-catalyzed ybbR tag labeling was mapped to the underlined Ser residue, and the ybbR tag was found to have a strong tendency for adopting an alpha-helical conformation in solution. Here we demonstrate that the ybbR tag can be fused to the N or C termini of target proteins or inserted in a flexible loop in the middle of a target protein for site-specific protein labeling by Sfp. The short size of the ybbR tag and its compatibility with various target proteins, the broad substrate specificity of Sfp for labeling the ybbR tag with small-molecule probes of diverse structures, and the high specificity and efficiency of the labeling reaction make Sfp-catalyzed ybbR tag labeling an attractive tool for expanding protein structural and functional diversities by posttranslational modification.},

DMABN is considered the paradigm of photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), leading to dual fluorescence in polar solvents. By comparison of calculated emission energies, dipole moments, and vibrational frequencies with recent results from transient spectroscopy measurements, a definitive assignment of the electronic and geometric structure of the two lowest singlet excited states of DMABN is possible for the first time. We investigate the mechanism of the ICT reaction by means of minimum energy path calculations. The results confirm existing state-crossing models of dual fluorescence. Our study suggests that analytical TDDFT derivative methods will be useful to predict and classify emissive properties of other donor-acceptor systems as well.},

The most commonly used luciferase for in vivo applications is firefly luciferase (fLuc), for which D-luciferin serves as the substrate. We demonstrated previously that the expression of the ABCG2 efflux transporter can significantly reduce BLI signal output and that HhAntag-691 can inhibit the efflux of D-luciferin, thereby enhancing BLI signal. Here we show that an HhAntag-691-sensitive uptake mechanism facilitates the intracellular concentration of D-luciferin and that the BLI dynamics of different cell lines are coregulated by this uptake mechanism in conjunction with ABCG2-mediated efflux. After administration of D-luciferin, the HhAntag-691-sensitive uptake mechanism generates a rapid increase in BLI signal that decreases over time, whereas ABCG2-mediated efflux stably reduces signal output. We implicate SLC22A4 (OCTN1), a member of the organic cation/zwitterion uptake transporter family, as one potential mediator of the HhAntag-691-sensitive D-luciferin uptake. These findings provide insight into mechanisms that contribute to the cellular uptake kinetics and in vivo biodistribution of D-luciferin.},

  abstract = {Magnesium has important structural, catalytic and signaling roles in cells, yet few tools exist to image this metal ion in real time and at subcellular resolution. Here we report the first genetically encoded sensor for Mg2+, MagFRET-1. This sensor is based on the high-affinity Mg2+ binding domain of human centrin 3 (HsCen3), which undergoes a transition from a molten-globular apo form to a compactly-folded Mg2+-bound state. Fusion of Cerulean and Citrine fluorescent domains to the ends of HsCen3, yielded MagFRET-1, which combines a physiologically relevant Mg2+ affinity (Kd = 148 $\mathrm{\mu}$M) with a 50\% increase in emission ratio upon Mg2+ binding due to a change in FRET efficiency between Cerulean and Citrine. Mutations in the metal binding sites yielded MagFRET variants whose Mg2+ affinities were attenuated 2- to 100-fold relative to MagFRET-1, thus covering a broad range of Mg2+ concentrations. In situ experiments in HEK293 cells showed that MagFRET-1 can be targeted to the cytosol and the nucleus. Clear responses to changes in extracellular Mg2+ concentration were observed for MagFRET-1-expressing HEK293 cells when they were permeabilized with digitonin, whereas similar changes were not observed for intact cells. Although MagFRET-1 is also sensitive to Ca2+, this affinity is sufficiently attenuated (Kd of 10 $\mathrm{\mu}$M) to make the sensor insensitive to known Ca2+ stimuli in HEK293 cells. While the potential and limitations of the MagFRET sensors for intracellular Mg2+ imaging need to be further established, we expect that these genetically encoded and ratiometric fluorescent Mg2+ sensors could prove very useful in understanding intracellular Mg2+ homeostasis and signaling.},

  abstract = {Beetle luciferases produce different bioluminescence colors from green to red using the same d-luciferin substrate. Despite many studies of the mechanisms and structural determinants of bioluminescence colors with firefly luciferases, the identity of the emitters and the specific active site interactions responsible for bioluminescence color modulation remain elusive. To address these questions, we analyzed the bioluminescence spectra with 6'-amino-D-luciferin (aminoluciferin) and its 5,5-dimethyl analogue using a set of recombinant beetle luciferases that naturally elicit different colors and different pH sensitivities (pH-sensitive, Amydetes vivianii $\lambda$max=538 nm, Macrolampis sp2 $\lambda$max=564 nm; pH-insensitive, Phrixotrix hirtus $\lambda$max=623 nm, Phrixotrix vivianii $\lambda$max=546 nm, and Pyrearinus termitilluminans $\lambda$max=534 nm), a luciferase-like enzyme (Tenebrionidae, Zophobas morio $\lambda$max=613 nm), and mutants of C311 (S314). The green-yellow-emitting luciferases display red-shifted bioluminescence spectra with aminoluciferin in relation to those with D-luciferin, whereas the red-emitting luciferases displayed blue-shifted spectra. Bioluminescence spectra with 5,5-dimethylaminoluciferin, in which enolization is blocked, were almost identical to those of aminoluciferin. Fluorescence probing using 2-(4-toluidino)naphthalene-6-sulfonate and inference with aminoluciferin confirm that the luciferin binding site of the red-shifted luciferases is more polar than in the case of the green-yellow-emitting luciferases. Altogether, the results show that the keto form of excited oxyluciferin is the emitter in beetle bioluminescence and that bioluminescence colors are essentially modulated by interactions of the 6'-hydroxy group of oxyluciferin and basic moieties under the influence of the microenvironment polarity of the active site: a strong interaction between a base moiety and oxyluciferin phenol in a hydrophobic microenvironment promotes green-yellow emission, whereas a more polar environment weakens such interaction promoting red shifts. In pH-sensitive luciferases, a pH-mediated switch from a closed hydrophobic conformation to a more open polar conformation promotes the typical red shift.},

Given that a single protein may serve more than one function, fitness should be assessed in several dimensions. In the present study we have explored individual mutational steps leading to a triple-point-mutated human GST (glutathione transferase) A2-2 displaying enhanced activity with azathioprine. A total of eight alternative substrates were used to monitor the diverse evolutionary trajectories. The epistatic effects of the mutations on catalytic activity were variable in sign and magnitude and depended on the substrate used, showing that epistasis is a multidimensional quality. Evidently, the multidimensional fitness landscape can lead to alternative trajectories resulting in enzymes optimized for features other than the selectable markers relevant at the origin of the evolutionary process. In this manner the evolutionary response is robust and can adapt to changing environmental conditions.

  volume = {35},
  doi = {10.1007/s00259-008-0870-6},
  abstract = {PURPOSE:Firefly luciferase catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of D: -luciferin to oxyluciferin in the presence of cofactors, producing bioluminescence. This reaction is used in optical bioluminescence-based molecular imaging approaches to detect the expression of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. Biokinetics and distribution of the substrate most likely have a significant impact on levels of light signal and therefore need to be investigated.

METHODS:Benzene ring (14)C(U)-labeled D-luciferin was utilized. Cell uptake and efflux assays, murine biodistribution, autoradiography and CCD-camera based optical bioluminescence imaging were carried out to examine the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of the tracer in cell culture and in living mice respectively.

RESULTS:Radiolabeled and unlabeled D-luciferin revealed comparable levels of light emission when incubated with equivalent amounts of the firefly luciferase enzyme. Cell uptake assays in pCMV-luciferase-transfected cells showed slow trapping of the tracer and relatively low uptake values (up to 22.9-fold higher in firefly luciferase gene-transfected vs. nontransfected cells, p = 0.0002). Biodistribution studies in living mice after tail-vein injection of (14)C-D-luciferin demonstrated inhomogeneous tracer distribution with early predominant high radioactivity levels in kidneys (10.6\% injected dose [ID]/g) and liver (11.9\% ID/g), followed at later time points by the bladder (up to 81.3\% ID/g) and small intestine (6.5\% ID/g), reflecting the elimination routes of the tracer. Kinetics and uptake levels profoundly differed when using alternate injection routes (intravenous versus intraperitoneal). No clear trapping of (14)C-D-luciferin in firefly luciferase-expressing tissues could be observed in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS:The data obtained with (14)C-D-luciferin provide insights into the dynamics of D: -luciferin cell uptake, intracellular accumulation, and efflux. Results of the biodistribution and autoradiographic studies should be useful for optimizing and adapting optical imaging protocols to specific experimental settings when utilizing the firefly luciferase and D: -luciferin system.},

We demonstrate that the multivalent and bispecific format allows the antiCD3/antiCD22 CSANs to stably bind to T-cell surfaces for greater than 4 days, while being easily disassembled on the cell membrane by treatment with the nontoxic FDA approved drug, trimethoprim. In the presence of CD22+ Raji cells, T-cells modified with antiCD3/antiCD22 CSANs were shown to selectively up-regulate the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$) and to initiate cytotoxicity.

Bioluminescence of the indicator diminished upon light irradiation and it recovered gradually in the dark state thereafter. The recovery rate was remarkably sensitive to pH changes but unsusceptible to fluctuation of luciferin or ATP concentrations. Bioluminescence imaging, taken as an index of the recovery rates, enabled long-time recording of acidification in apoptotic and autophagous processes in a cell population and an ischemic condition in living mice.

  abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list\textemdash{}reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

First, we conjugated a far-red fluorescent indocyanine derivative to biotinylated Cypridina luciferase. This conjugate produced a bimodal spectrum that has long-wavelength bioluminescence emission in the far-red region as a result of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer. To generate a far-red luminescent probe with targeting and imaging capabilities of tumors, we then linked this conjugate to an anti-human Dlk-1 monoclonal antibody via the biotin-avidin interaction. This far-red luminescent probe enabled us to obtain high-resolution microscopic images of live, Dlk-1-expressing Huh-7 cells without an external light source, and to monitor the accumulation of this probe in tumor-bearing mice. Thus this far-red luminescent probe is a convenient analytical tool for the evaluations of monoclonal antibody localization in a living body.},

The method provides access to a range of usefully functionalized derivatives of trans-cyclooctene, including a derivative of 5-aza-trans-cyclooctene that underwent transannular cyclization upon treatment with bromine. The alkene stereochemistry is transferred with high fidelity to the hexahydropyrrolizine framework in the transannular cyclization.},

A wealth of research aims to elucidate the functions of this code, but our understanding of the effects of PTMs, specifically the methylation of lysine (Lys) and arginine (Arg), is lacking. The development of new tools to study PTMs relies on a sophisticated understanding of the mechanisms that drive protein and small molecule recognition in water. In this review, we outline the physical organic concepts that drive the molecular recognition of Lys and Arg methylation by reader proteins and draw comparisons to the binding mechanisms of small molecule receptors for methylated Lys and Arg that have been developed recently.},

Molecular transporter conjugates of otherwise poorly soluble or poorly bioavailable drugs or probes exhibit excellent solubility in water and biological fluids and at the same time an enhanced ability to enter tissues and cells and with modification to do so selectively. For many conjugates, however, it is necessary to release the drug/probe cargo from the transporter after uptake to achieve activity. Here, we describe an imaging method that provides quantification of transporter conjugate uptake and cargo release in real-time in animal models. This method uses transgenic (luciferase) reporter mice and whole-body imaging, allowing noninvasive quantification of transporter conjugate uptake and probe (luciferin) release in real time. This process effectively emulates drug-conjugate delivery, drug release, and drug turnover by an intracellular target, providing a facile method to evaluate comparative uptake of new transporters and efficacy and selectivity of linker release as required for fundamental studies and therapeutic applications.},

Of the 72 designs that were experimentally characterized, 32, spanning a range of protein folds, had detectable retro-aldolase activity. Designs that used an explicit water molecule to mediate proton shuffling were significantly more successful, with rate accelerations of up to four orders of magnitude and multiple turnovers, than those involving charged side-chain networks. The atomic accuracy of the design process was confirmed by the x-ray crystal structure of active designs embedded in two protein scaffolds, both of which were nearly superimposable on the design model.},

Libraries of ATFs enable the high-throughput screening of gene networks that trigger cell fate decisions or phenotypic changes. We developed a genome-scale library of ATFs that display an engineered interaction domain (ID) to enable cooperative assembly and synergistic gene expression at targeted sites. We used this ATF library to screen for key regulators of the pluripotency network and discovered three combinations of ATFs capable of inducing pluripotency without exogenous expression of Oct4 (POU domain, class 5, TF 1). Cognate site identification, global transcriptional profiling, and identification of ATF binding sites reveal that the ATFs do not directly target Oct4; instead, they target distinct nodes that converge to stimulate the endogenous pluripotency network. This forward genetic approach enables cell type conversions without a priori knowledge of potential key regulators and reveals unanticipated gene network dynamics that drive cell fate choices.},

Studies have validated the use of reporter genes with positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), MRI, fluorescence with wild-type and mutants of green fluorescent protein, as well as bioluminescence using Firefly luciferase enzyme/protein (FL). In the current study, we validate for the first time the ability to image bioluminescence from Renilla luciferase enzyme/protein (RL) by injecting the substrate coelenterazine in living mice. A highly sensitive cooled charge-coupled device camera provides images within a few minutes of photon counting. Cells, transiently expressing the Rluc were imaged while located in the peritoneum, s.c. layer, as well as in the liver and lungs of living mice tail-vein injected with coelenterazine. Furthermore, d-luciferin (a substrate for FL) does not serve as a substrate for RL, and coelenterazine does not serve as a substrate for FL either in cell culture or in living mice. We also show that both Rluc and Fluc expression can be imaged in the same living mouse and that the kinetics of light production are distinct. The approaches validated will have direct applications to various studies where two molecular events need to be tracked, including cell trafficking of two cell populations, two gene therapy vectors, and indirect monitoring of two endogenous genes through the use of two reporter genes.},

These studies demonstrate that both the engineered and wild-type firefly luciferases tolerate much greater steric bulk at the 6' position of luciferin than has been previously reported. The nature of the alkyl substituent strongly affects the strength of the bioluminescent signal, which varies widely based on size, shape, and charge. Several compounds were observed to generate more light than the corresponding unsubstituted 6'-aminoluciferin. Determination of Michaelis-Menten constants for the substrates with Ultra-Glo indicated that the variation arises primarily from differences in V max, ranging from 1.33 x 10 (4) to 332 x 10 (4) relative light units, but in some cases K m (0.73-10.8 microM) also plays a role. Molecular modeling results suggest that interactions of the side chain with a hydrogen-bonding network at the base of the luciferin binding pocket may influence substrate-enzyme binding.},

Chem. 272, 19359-19364] that 2-(4-benzoylphenyl)thiazole-4-carboxylic acid (BPTC), a firefly luciferin analogue, was a potent photoinactivation reagent for luciferase. We identified a luciferase peptide 244HHGF247, the degradation of which was directly correlated to the photooxidation process. We report here the construction and purification of wild-type and mutant luciferases H244F, H245F, H245A, and H245D. The results of photoinactivation and kinetic and bioluminescence studies with these proteins are consistent with His245 being the primary functional target of BPTC-catalyzed enzyme inactivation. The possibility that His245 is oxidized to aspartate during the photooxidation reaction was supported by the extremely low specific activity ( approximately 300-fold lower than WT) of the H245D mutant. Using the crystal structures of luciferase without substrates [Conti, E., Franks, N. P., and Brick, P.

The versatility of this technology is demonstrated by delivering dCas9 fusions that include either the small-molecule bromodomain and extra-terminal family bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 or a peptide-based PRC1 chromodomain ligand, which are capable of recruiting endogenous copies of their cognate binding partners to targeted genomic binding sites.

The sensor 1 showed characteristic dual fluorescence and it was shown that the guanidinium group in the proximity of the DMAB group influenced largely the TICT formation process in 1. Liquid/liquid extraction experiments demonstrated that the intensity ratio of the TICT fluorescence to the locally-excited (LE) fluorescence (ITICT/ILE) observed from the organic layer decreased with an increase in the concentration of N-acetyl-D-phenylalanine (AcPhe) in the water phase. Such fluorescence titration experiments afforded the apparent binding constant between 1 and AcPhe to be 7.0 \texttimes{} 105 M-1. Temperature dependence of the fluorescence spectrum of 1 in the absence and presence of AcPhe indicated that the primary origin of the change in the ITICT/ILE value upon recognition of the amino acid was the increase in the activation energy of the TICT formation process in 1.},

  abstract = {Enzyme regulation proteins are very important due to their involvement in many biological processes that sustain life. The complexity of these proteins, the impossibility of identifying direct quantification molecular properties associated with the regulation of enzymatic activities, and their structural diversity creates the necessity for new theoretical methods that can predict the enzyme regulatory function of new proteins. The current work presents the first classification model that predicts protein enzyme regulators using the Markov mean properties. These protein descriptors encode the topological information of the amino acid into contact networks based on amino acid distances and physicochemical properties. MInD-Prot software calculated these molecular descriptors for 2415 protein chains (350 enzyme regulators) using five atom physicochemical properties (Mulliken electronegativity, Kang-Jhon polarizability, vdW area, atom contribution to P) and the protein 3D regions. The best classification models to predict enzyme regulators have been obtained with machine learning algorithms from Weka using 18 features. K* has been demonstrated to be the most accurate algorithm for this protein function classification. Wrapper Subset Evaluator and SVM-RFE approaches were used to perform a feature subset selection with the best results obtained from SVM-RFE. Classification performance employing all the available features can be reached using only the 8 most relevant features selected by SVM-RFE. Thus, the current work has demonstrated the possibility of predicting new molecular targets involved in enzyme regulation using fast theoretical algorithms.},

DNA interactomes of 80 heterodimers and 22 homodimers revealed that 72\% of heterodimer motifs correspond to conjoined half-sites preferred by partnering monomers. Remarkably, the remaining motifs are composed of variably-spaced half-sites (12\%) or 'emergent' sites (16\%) that cannot be readily inferred from half-site preferences of partnering monomers. These binding sites were biochemically validated by EMSA-FRET analysis and validated in vivo by ChIP-seq data from human cell lines. Focusing on ATF3, we observed distinct cognate site preferences conferred by different bZIP partners, and demonstrated that genome-wide binding of ATF3 is best explained by considering many dimers in which it participates. Importantly, our compendium of bZIP-DNA interactomes predicted bZIP binding to 156 disease associated SNPs, of which only 20 were previously annotated with known bZIP motifs.},

Memory formation is thought to change the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. However, direct measurements between neurons that participate in a learning process are difficult to obtain. Choi et al. developed the ``dual-eGRASP'' technique to identify synaptic connections between hippocampal CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells. This method could label two different sets of synapses so that their convergence on the same dendrites would be quantified. After contextual fear conditioning in mice, the number and size of spines were increased on CA1 engram cells receiving input from CA3 engram cells.
Science, this issue p. 430
Memory resides in engram cells distributed across the brain. However, the site-specific substrate within these engram cells remains theoretical, even though it is generally accepted that synaptic plasticity encodes memories. We developed the dual-eGRASP (green fluorescent protein reconstitution across synaptic partners) technique to examine synapses between engram cells to identify the specific neuronal site for memory storage. We found an increased number and size of spines on CA1 engram cells receiving input from CA3 engram cells. In contextual fear conditioning, this enhanced connectivity between engram cells encoded memory strength. CA3 engram to CA1 engram projections strongly occluded long-term potentiation. These results indicate that enhanced structural and functional connectivity between engram cells across two directly connected brain regions forms the synaptic correlate for memory formation.
Memory strength can be explained by enhanced structural and functional connectivity among engram neurons in mice.

SCA uses homologous enzymes to identify amino acid positions that are mutable and functionally important and engage in synergistic interactions between amino acids. We use SCA to guide a library of the protein luciferase and demonstrate that, in a single round of selection, we can identify luciferase mutants with several valuable properties. Specifically, we identify luciferase mutants that possess both red-shifted emission spectra and improved stability relative to those of the wild-type enzyme. We also identify luciferase mutants that possess a $>$50-fold change in specificity for modified luciferins. To understand the mutational origin of these improved mutants, we demonstrate the role of mutations at N229, S239, and G246 in altered function. These studies show that SCA can be used to guide library design and rapidly identify synergistic amino acid mutations from a small library.},

Non-invasive BLI monitoring of the implanted mice showed that the PLuc/RLuc ratio reports on gene expression changes indicative of cell differentiation. Large (CL1) and moderated (hAMSCs) changes in the PLuc/RLuc ratio over a 6 week period, revealed different patterns of in vivo chondrogenic differentiation for the CL1 cell line and primary MSCs, in agreement with in vitro published data and our results from histological analysis of DBM sections.

In the current study, we explore the expression of a novel synthetic \emph{Renilla }luciferase reporter gene (hRluc) in living mice, which has previously been reported to be a more sensitive reporter than native Rluc in mammalian cells. We explore the strategies of simultaneous imaging of both \emph{Renilla }luciferase enzyme (RL) and synthetic \emph{Renilla} luciferase enzyme (hRL):coelenterazine (substrate for RL/hRL) in the same living mouse. We also demonstrate that hRL:coelenterazine can yield a higher signal when compared to Firefly luciferase enzyme (FL): D-Luciferin, both in cell culture studies and when imaged from cells at the surface and from lungs of living mice. These studies demonstrate that hRluc should be a useful primary reporter gene with high sensitivity when used alone or in conjunction with other bioluminescence reporter genes for imaging in living rodents.},
